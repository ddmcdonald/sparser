Extended 8/23 through 9/99. 1/4/00 added facilities for;; tsro-choosers. Resumed tweaking 6/21.;; 0.1 (7/25) Rewrote ETF-or-rdata as Analyze-realization-data to do a far more;;      extensive examination. Fixing bugs and adding traces through 8/27.;; 12/27/09 Moved here from stravinsky: ts-readers;drivers since it's already;;   doing a lot of the heavy lifting even if it is still in bundle-speak.;;   Only changed enough to load and execute.;; 2/18/12 Commented out include of sparser:unit -- load order needs fixing;; 4/22/12 Fixed unknown fns, missing hooks, lower-case of struct definition;; 0.1 (10/25/13) Lifted the schema decoders and moved them to tree-families/rdata1;;     (12/28/13) moved in word code from conversions.(in-package :mumble);;;-----------------------------------------------------;;; getting the realizations associated with a category;;;-----------------------------------------------------(defun ETF-or-rdata (category)  (declare (ignore category))  (break "Who's the caller - renamed 'analyze-realization-data"));;;
