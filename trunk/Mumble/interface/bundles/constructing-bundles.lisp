; These are subroutines for use by Templates. They are not expected
; ever to be called at toplevel as a message is being built.
; Their domain is the structure of realization specifications, not
; matters semantic or (even) linguistic.

;; ChangeLog
;;  1/17/95 ddm -- Updated MAKE-A-KERNEL to refer to 'tree-family'
;;    rather than 'realization-class'
;;  3/25 ddm -- added 2d optional argument to ADD-ACCESSORY to mark
;;    that the accessory value is to be taken as is.
;;  3/26 ddm -- added data check to ADD-FURTHER-SPECIFICATION for the 
;;    ap being a symbol.
;;  8/27/00 -- allowed MAKE-A-BUNDLE to take a bundle-type as an
;;    alternative to the name of one.
