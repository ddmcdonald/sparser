; ddm 8/13/99 Put a special case into Def-type to avoid a clash with a defstruct
;  off a symbol with the same pname. See note there.


; ddm 10/20/88   Added an "include" field to deftypes -- as an obligatory second 
; argument just after the "storage-type" and before the list of field names.   
; This just entailed modifying the definition of Def-type

; drf 11/21   fixed the problem with ``missing'' defstructs (for :include stuff)
; and added a routine to check whether functions are being redefined in an
; objectionable way -- still needs thorough testing, though!

; drf 11/24   first run of tests for routine to check redefinitions -- new property
; defined -- MUMBLE-TYPE-OBJECT-FOR-FIELD (new, so that it doesn't conflict with
; MUMBLE-TYPE-OBJECT) -- needs further testing, but should work

; drf 11/25   checked DEF-TYPE code, complete with a small short-circuit for the
; def-type of the CATALOG, called DEF-TYPE-NO-CONFLICTS (documented below).

; drf 87/Mar/14 - Common LISP compatibility
; 1. added (:CONC-NAME NIL) to DEFSTRUCTs -- is Zeta-LISP default,
;    but Common LISP defaults to  (:CONC-NAME <struct-name>-)
; 2. TYPEP usage tightened up (use 2 args for predicate, use TYPE-OF for
;    type of object
; 3. DEFCONST -> DEFCONSTANT
; 4. in MAKE-<struct>: symbols denoting fields changed to keywords
;    (DEFSTRUCT imported from CL package on Symbolics)
; 5. PUTPROP changed to SETF + GET (GET imported from CL package on Symbolics)

; drf 87/Apr/01 - Common LISP compatibility
; deleted (:type :named-array) from the generated defstruct in DEF-TYPE, since that
; prevents TYPEP and TYPE-OF from working properly (in Common-LISP, typep will not
; recognize the defstruct as constituting the declaration of a new type)

;################################################################
#|

  A type involves the following things:

   0. a construction function with name "make-<type-name>"
      that takes its arguments in keyword format using the field names
      of the type --  N.b. Defstruct uses macros. ///and so does
      def-type at the moment.

   0.a.  a minimal construction function with the name
      "make-an-empty-<type-name>", takes no arguments and just builds the
      shell of the object, expecting later operations to fill it in.

   1. a type-testing predicate with the name "<type-name>p"

   2. printing functions for:
        a. "MP"  a nice English-like name, e.g. "clause"
        b. Princ    -    #<label clause>
            This will be a format string + args (i.e. expressions over
            field names) that gets used by the ///// facility when
            we're implementing objects as structures.
        c. Pretty-printing -- ///possibly subdividing into one for
            mouse-based display windows and one for glass-tty's.
        d. Off-line file storage in an human-readable format.

   3. for each of the fields in objects of this type:

	a. an access FUNCTION with the same name as the property
           n.b. Defstruct supplies only macros.

        b. a set function with the name "clobber-<property>" as an
           alternative to the Setf construct.

   4. a "catalog" in which to store objects of this type and various
      usefull cross-indexing relations about them.

   5. a function for postprocessing any object of this type.

   5. An object of type "type", in which to attach all this information.


Syntax:

 (DEF-TYPE  <type-name>     { PERMANENT | TEMPORARY | SYSTEM-OVERHEAD }
       <field-descriptor> *
       )

 <field-descriptor> :==   ( <symbol to use as the field name>
                            <documentation string in Format style> )

n.b.  The storage-type indicators ("permanent", "temporary",...) are wishfull
thinking about the future when some kind of "semantic paging" is available.

;  The function DEF-TYPE makes reference to two types itself:
;                  MTYPE and MCATALOG
;  therefore some boot-strapping is in order -- otherwise you
;  get bit by Russell's paradox if you try to use the function Def-type
;  to create the type for type.

#|  There is a problem (like the TYPE-OF-TYPE problem) with catalogs and
checking for fields with conflicts.  Because CATALOG is defined via 
Defstruct, accessor functions are already defined for the fields.  This
messes up our home-grown type checker, so the following kludge is built
in: we short-circuit the type-checker code with the global variable
*check-for-type-conflicts* -- checks are made only if it is non-NIL -- and
wrap code around the def-type call which sets the variable temporarily
to NIL.
