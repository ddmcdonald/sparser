;; ChangeLog
;;  6/7/95 uncommented fancy-browser option in flush-last-punctuation-mark-from-text-
;;    output-stream
;;  8/13/99 Introduced cases into Precede-item-with-space-if-appropriate to 
;;    accomodate new punctuation types that don't take spaces after themselves;;  5/5/03 Added code-level documentation


; There are two kinds of things that have to happen in the management of
; the word stream: linguistic things and software things.  We try to layer
; this code so that the details needed to make the words actually appear on
; a screen are below the linguistic processing and can thus be relatively
; easily changed as the software environment is varied.

;; Overview
; The entry point is Send-to-output-stream. It recieves the print names
; of words as they are read out of the phrase structure via a call from 
; Morphologically-specialize-&-say-it in grammar>morphology.lisp. 
; The way out from this level is via send-item-to-physical-word-stream
; and its variants such as pass-a-space-to-the-text-output-stream.
;
; Calls to this entry point will also come in from word-stream actions
; that are associated with slot or node labels. These can pass in
; blips, punctuation marks, or a possessive-marker (see 
; objects/all-the-object-types.lisp in the section labeled "words").
;
; The rules that this level understands are hard coded and managed by
; dispatches on the word-object that has just come in and the prior
; object.


;; All the state we need is kept in the values of these three
;; globals.  They are initialized by initialize-output-stream
;; and managed by update-the-stream-vector.

; Last-item and last-item-printed are distinguished so that we can
