* Sparser's Documentation

If you are completely new to Sparser you should start by reading the
1992 Applied Natural Language Processing conference paper in the papers
directory and skim crib-sheet.pdf. That is enough to get you started.

For a detailed picture of Sparser's data structures and basic operations
you should skim the manual. It's eight chapters provide a thorough
descriptions of Sparser circa 1993 when it was licensed as a commercial
system to several companies. 

The manual was never extended beyond what was important those customers, 
and so the bulk of what is important now is not covered, particularly
Sparser's native knowledge representation system, its built-in core
grammar, and the schemas that are used today to extend the semantic
model and the semantic grammar it automatically generates. 

To get this information you want to consult the notes files. This are
continually being extended and updated and give you the most detailed
picture presently available.
