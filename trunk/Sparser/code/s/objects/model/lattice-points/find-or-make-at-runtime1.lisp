;;;   Module:  "objects;model:lattice-points:"
;;;  version:  1.0 July 2009

;; This is the entry point at runtime for objects (psi) that are
;; seen in the course of an analysis.

;; initiated 9/12/98, out of largely already existing routines. Tweaked the
;; name of a call 2/14/99. 9/3 Renamed call in Find-or-make-self-node to accomodate
;; forced change elsewhere. 
;; 1.0 (7/22/09) Simplified for new indexing regime.
