;; initiated 3/7/98. Started fleshing it out 3/22. Continued through
;; 7/5. 5/11/99 put an initializer into Rule-component-to-use because
;; the parameters it uses isn't initialized at load time.
;; 0.1 (6/4) started trying to tie the rnodes of successive unary
;;      nodes together like binary nodes are in Annotate-individual.
;;     (6/8) did the case for numbers, modulo the fact that they
;;      aren't yet assigning their components to roles.
;;     (6/22) Wrote populate-rules-that-are-fsas to flesh out the other
;;      case of a table that has to be instantiated late. 
;;     (8/99) Elaborating the cases a little at a time while marching
;;      through the lower parts of the ISI example from numbers and money
;;      on up.
;;     (2/21/00) Tweaked Head-and-ather-edges-of-binary-rule to look for
;;      the keyword :head as well as :head-edge in the descriptors field
;;      of rule schemas. That there are two terms is certainly a historical
;;      artificat, but this is expedient.
;;     (2/26) gave Sort-out-head-vs-arg-rnodes-in-binary-rule an interpretation
;;      of what to do when the referents are categories or words.
;;     (3/26) Modified Rnode-for-edge to not complain if there is no rnode so 
;;      that initial cases could be accomodated. Modifed Annotate-individual
;;      to take a new case for where its head and arg up pointers come from
;;      using the indicate-head/indicate-arg facility that ref/head employs.
;;      Also (!) made annotate-individual consistent with annotate-realization/
;;      base-case by assigning the rnode's backpointer to a lattice point
;;      rather than the individual whose realization is being annotated.
;;      Elaborated Add-rnode-to-its-individual to handle more types.
;;     (12/26) Added an empty case for composite-referents to Annotate-site-bound-to
;;      since I didn't know what the right treatment would be.
;;     (2/10/05) Quieted an unguarded format statement. (2/17) ditto a reference to
;;      composites in Annotate-site-bound-to
;;     (10/31/06) Added *annotate-realizations* switch to control whether this
;;      stuff runs.
;; 0.2 (3/19/11) Updated & revitalized the code. Continued through 5/16/11.
