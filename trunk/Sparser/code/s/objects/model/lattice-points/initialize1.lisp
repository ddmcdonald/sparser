;;;     File:  "initialize"
;;;   Module:  "objects;model:lattice-points:"
;;;  version:  1.0 August 2009

;; initiated 11/29/97. Moved code in from other files 7/7/98. 9/3/99 renamed
;; Construct-self-lattice-point to avoid brain-dead conflict with the
;; constructor of the structure. 9/7 extended that routine to set the 
;; upward pointer of the new node so that you can successfully climb
;; through it. 3/20/00 Added to Index-node-to-top-point so that it would
;; properly set the down pointers of the top-lp, thereby fixing bug that
;; find wasn't working.
;; 0.1 (6/21) Reworked the constructors to use the resource mechanism.
;; (2/8/05) Added category-of-self-lattice-point. (2/9) fixed bug in
;; Index-node-to-top-point when the entry exists but the new lp node
;; isn't in it and there's just one lp in the entry at this point. (2/17) fixed
;; problem with Find-self-node returning a list instead of the self-lp.
;; 1.0 (7/22/09) Fan out from simplifying the indexing structure and putting more
;;   on the psi. Working on it through 8/6.
