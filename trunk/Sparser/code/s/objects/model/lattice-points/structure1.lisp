;;;   Module:  "objects;model:lattice-points:"
;;;  version:  1.2 March 2011

;; initiated 11/29/97
;; 0.1 (2/24/98) Started reworking the initial sketch to fit all the 
;;      ideas worked out in January. Continuing tweaking through 7/7.
;; 0.2 (6/8/99) modified realization-node to remove the uplinks as
;;      obsolete.
;; 0.3 (9/12) Added 'psi-uses' to psi-lattice-points and c+v and
;;      indiv-uses to top-lattice points. 
;;     (4/10/00) Added psi-uses to self-lattice-points as well.
;; 0.4 (6/21) Added an index.
;; 0.5 (3/4/05) added v+v index to top nodes. (8/15/07) moved in the c+v
;;      and v+v structs so an early load will get everything. 
;; 1.0 (7/22/09) Substantial adjustments to move more information to the psi
;;      objects. (8/30) Added a subtype of v+v for the top category case.
;; 1.1 (11/14/10) Revived the c+v & such of the top lp struct to sustain
;;      realizations. Fixed conc-name bug in category+value.
;; 1.2 (1/25/11) Removed need to check against core-omar.
;;     (3/23/11) Uncommented out upward-links and added variable to
;;      realization-node.
