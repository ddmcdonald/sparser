;; initiated 11/18/91  v2.1
;; 1.1 (7/92 v2.3) shifted from gl entries to straight categories
;; 1.2 (8/31) Removed the /check from the category lookup for the
;;     restrictions on variables.
;; 2.0 (6/19/09) Shifts to a lexical treatment, eliminates global indexes.
;;   (7/20) Accommodations for the toplevel form using symbols, first
;;   encountered in the load-order in sl/ambush/checkpoint
;; 2.1 (3/9/13) trying to allow a mix of categories and a primitive
;;    in a value restriction. 
;; 2.2 (4/5/13) Storing free-defined variables with the category's
;;    other binding variables.
;; 2.3 (5/26/13) Changed the variable-restriction category lookup from
;;    the check variant that complains if a category is not yet defined
;;    to resolve-or-make/symbol-to-category which makes it. Everything
;;    goes to referential categories now that the model is ubiquitous,
;;    so the object will just be fleshed out when it's finally encountered.
;;   (11/13/13) Added registration.
