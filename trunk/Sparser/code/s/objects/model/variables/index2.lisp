;; initiated 11/18/91 v2.1, typo 11/24
;; 1.1 (7/92 v2.3) shifted from gl entries to straight categories
;; 1.2 (6/2/93) fixed missing case in Find/lambda-variable.
;; 1.3 (8/5/94) wrote Next-variable-id as value of the :lattice-site field
;; 1.4 (7/7/95) added superc check to Find-variable-for-category
;; 2.0 (6/16/09) Switching to a lexical treatment.
;; 2.1 (7/20/09) Added back in lambda-variable-named but have it returning
;;   the new notion of an anonymous-variable that will be replaces with
;;   a 'real' one that's associated with a category at runtime, i.e. when
;;   rules are executed. (12/14/10) method-ized find-variable-in-category
;;   to handle lattice points as the value of the type field.
;;   (1/18/11) Wrote swap-variable-in-binding. 4/1/13 Added signature for
;;   individuals for dereference-variable. 10/17/13 added signature to get
;;   categories via symbols in find-variable-in-category.
;;   (10/31/13) added find-variable-in-mixins to the mix.
;;   (11/13/13) Finished var name registration that lets you get a single
;;    variable from the name if that's the case.

 categories that define them. There can be several variables with the same
 name provided that they are associated with different categories. |#
