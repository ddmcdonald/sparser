;; initiated 11/18/91 v2.1, typo 11/24
;; 1.1 (7/92 v2.3) shifted from gl entries to straight categories
;; 1.2 (6/2/93) fixed missing case in Find/lambda-variable.
;; 1.3 (8/5/94) wrote Next-variable-id as value of the :lattice-site field
;; 1.4 (7/7/95) added superc check to Find-variable-for-category
;; 2.0 (6/16/09) Switching to a lexical treatment.
;; 2.1 (7/20/09) Added back in lambda-variable-named but have it returning
;;   the new notion of an anonymous-variable that will be replaces with
;;   a 'real' one that's associated with a category at runtime, i.e. when
;;   rules are executed. (12/14/10) method-ized find-variable-in-category
;;   to handle lattice points as the value of the type field.
;;   (1/18/11) Wrote swap-variable-in-binding.

#| In the 2009 scheme, variables are lexical entities that are local to the
 categories that define them. There can be several variables with the same
 name provided that they are associated with different categories. |#
