;; initiated 8/4/92 v2.3, fleshed out 8/10
;; 0.1 (10/24) Added processing of rule cases because of the words and
;;      categories they may mention (they're not all substitution terms!)
;; 0.2 (6/12/93) removed 'edge' symbols from the substitution terms list
;;      and made them explictly decoded since they have to change to work
;;      at runtime
;;     (5/3/94) fixed bug in treatment of ETFs with 'include'
;; 0.3 (5/17) put in explicit check for slashed substitution labels
;; 0.4 (10/17) extended legal items in the cases to include predefined categories.
;;      Motivation was 'apostrophe-s'. //Maybe it's overly broad?
;;     (2/22/95) added description keyword to the constructor and added collection
;;      of 'descriptors' to Decode-etf-rule-case
;; 0.5 (3/6) changed that to have the pattern descriptor computed here.
;; 0.6 (3/7) added 'schema-type' to the args.
;;     (4/27) fixed glitch that :includes wasn't promulgated to other calculations
;; 0.7 (7.26) tweeked decode-referent-exp to allow for returning categories
;; 1.0 (12/6/97) Modified Decode-etf-rule-case and friends to made cases into objects.
;;     (5/5) added tree-family setting to Decode-etf-rule-case.
;; 1.1 (4/11/05) Fixed odd case in Decode-referent-exp1 by moving 'when's into
;;  the cond. (4/20/09) Removed a useless trace-statement
;; 1.2 (9/17/09) Added possibility of an explict :form label since too many of
;;  the rules were coming out with no form so the automatic scheme is too weak.
;; 1.3 (7/7/09) Added form-category as possible type for rhs of decode-etf-rule-case.
;;  Also, I doubt v1.2 was actually created on 9/17/09 without a time machine. :)
;; 1.4 (8/10/11) Added :method analogous to :function in decode-referent-term, and
;;     put in a hack to identify the form of the result from the form category
;;     on the rhs. 
;; 1.5 (8/30/11) Modified default form calculation to look at lhs first. 
;;     (3/19/13) Improved error message in decode-referent-term
