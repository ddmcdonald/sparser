;;;   Module:  "objects;model:tree-families:"
;;;  version:  1.4 December 2011

;; initiated 8/4/92 v2.3, fleshed out 8/10, added more cases 8/31
;; 0.1 (5/25/93) changed what got stored, keeping around a dereferenced
;;      version of the rdata so that individuals could prompt rule definition
;; 0.2 (10/25) Allowed mappings to multiple categories
;;     (1/17/94) added :adjective as a option for heads. 5/24 added 'time-deictic'
;;     5/26 aded 'adverb'  10/6 added option for a label to be a word
;; 0.3 (10/20) rewrote 'time-deictic' as 'standalone-word'
;; 0.4 (11/1) hacked Setup-rdata to have rules be written even when the head word
;;      specifies a variable rather than a word
;; 1.0 (12/6/97) bumped on general principles given new work on psi.
;;     (7/5/98) modified Decode-rdata-mapping to allow lists of words.
;; 1.1 (7/12) provided for multiple definitions.
;;     (6/24/99) Added standalone rdata assembler to solve timing problems.
;;     (7/3) renamed it '1'.
;; 1.2 (9/3) Adjusted Dereference-rdata to use the symbol :no-head-word
;;      when there isn't one, instead of the value nil. This solved a problem
;;      with the rdata of currency.
;;     (9/30) Tweaked Decode-rdata-mapping to appreciate the possibility that
;;      a parameter could get the value :self.
;;     (11/18) Added :preposition to the list in Vet-rdata-keywords and
;;      dereference-rdata. (7/11/00) added :quantifier.  (4/11/05) added check 
;;      to Decode-rdata-mapping to allow symbols to pass on through if they're
;;      the names of functions. (7/23/09) Added interjection.
;; 1.3 (2/21/11) Added define-marker-category as another standalone def form
;;      where we're defining a minimal category along with its realization.
;; 1.4 (8/11/11) moved in define-realization from the workbench file it
;;      was in (interface/workbench/def-rule/save1.lisp). Refactored setup-
;;      rdata a bit to allow a standalone realization spec to add to the
;;      existing rules rather than replace them: define-additional-realization.
;;      8/16 fixed decode-rdata-mapping to accommodate references to variables
;;      that are in the category's parents. 9/6/11 propogated change to
;;      override-label in decode-rdata-mapping. 12/10/11 added :verb to the
;;      set of rdata keywords.
