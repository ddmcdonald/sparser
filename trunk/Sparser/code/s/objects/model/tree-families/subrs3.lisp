;; initiated 8/4/92 v2.3. Fleshed out 8/28
;; 0.1 (6/6/93) Added decoding of symbolic specializations like vg/+ed
;; 1.0 (10/14/94) changed the scheme slightly to allow for other constructed
;;      categories than just stems ..10/17
;; 1.1 (2/23/95) changed what Decode-slashed-label returns in the case where there
;;      isn't a slash but the caller says that's ok: real value is second after a
;;      nil in 'values'.
;; 1.2 (5/15) tweeked Strip-specializing-slash to return values.
;; 2.0 (6/22) added another, relatively complex option to decoding slashes
;; 2.1 (1/17/96) finished Strip-specializing-slash
;;     (3/13) made a note of possible extension to Appears-as-lhs-of-some-case
;; 2.2 (7/13/98) included possiblilty of multiple mappings for a constructed term.
;;     (4/13/09) Added polyword case to ccl/2e
;; 3.0 (7/24/09) Now that variables are lexicalized we have to pass the category
;;      down to the interpretation of the mapping to ensure that the correct,
;;      category-specific variables are used.
