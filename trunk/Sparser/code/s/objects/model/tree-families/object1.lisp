;;;  version:  1.1 June 2009

;; initiated 8/4/92. Added accumulator list and description field 2/22/95.
;; Added type field 3/7.  Tweeked def routine 4/27
;; 1.0 (12/6/97) Added a structure for schematic-rules ('cases').
;;     (2/14/98) debugged the find routine for them and did the printer.
;;     (5/5) added tree-family to schematic-rule.
;; 1.1 (6/17/09) added 'form' field to schematic-rule structure
