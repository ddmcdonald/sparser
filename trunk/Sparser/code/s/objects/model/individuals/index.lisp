;; initiated 7/16/92 v2.3
;; 0.1 (9/18/93) added index/individual/seq-keys
;;     (10/22) finished it
;; 0.2 (1/7/94) extended index-aux.. to look up the lattice
;; 0.3 (8/8) added lists of instances to the plists of categories and wrote
;;      All-instances-of and Instance# referencing it.
;;     (8/9) pulled the indexing code to [index instances]. 9/10 glitch fix.
;; 0.4 (10/4) remodularized aux routine so special cases would have an entry point
;;     (4/20/95) reworking scheme for permanent objects
;; 0.5 (3/22/98) Moved Lookup-fn-data-of-parent to [lattice-points;operations]
;; 0.6 (9/30/99) Modified Index-aux/individual to allow for there not being any
;;      fn-data -- there will be less and less as the model evolves because of
;;      increasing reliance on psi.
;;     (1/11/11) Fixed call to field of operations in index-aux/individual
;;      when the category didn't have any because it was made by DM&P.
;; 0.7 (6/3/13) Clarifying treatment of permanent vs. reclaim-able
;; 0.8 (6/14/13) Generalized all-instances to do hash-tables. 6/17 cleaned up
;;      from initially going overboard.
