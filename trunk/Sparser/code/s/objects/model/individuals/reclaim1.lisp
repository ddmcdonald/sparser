;;;  version:  1.1 September 1999

;; initiated 7/21/92 v2.3. Fleshed out 8/8/94. 
;; 10/3 Added some useful collectors.  11/16 added Delete/individual
;; 0.1 (4/3/95) made Zero-category-index sensitive to hashtables
;;     (4/20) added Add-permanent-individual and cleaned up a little
;; 1.0 (5/13/95) Added notion of a permanent individual that appears on a separate
;;      list and isn't recycled.
;; 1.1 (7/7) put a patch in Additional-categories.. when the i-type-of returned nil.
;;     (9/30/99) Somewhen in the interim I null-ified declare-all-existing-individuals-
;;      permanent by doing a return-from before it had done anything. No record available
;;      of why. Put it all back today and nothing untoward happened when I ran it.
