;;;  version:  0.5 December 2010

;; pulled from [find] 5/25/93 v2.3
;; 0.1 (9/18) added referential-categories to the options for decoding
;; 0.2 (10/22) tweeked cases to allow strings interpreted as names
;; 0.3 (12/29) added null check against value-exps in decoding
;;     (5/24) added 'position' as a type of primitive
;;     (7/28) added 'fixnum' and 'cons'
;; 0.4 (8/5) incorporated 'or' into the value decoding v/r check
;;     (8/17) incorporated 'or' into primitives
;;     (8/23) put a null-check in for the variable when decoding binding instructions
;;     (12/19) added case of symbol
;;     (12/26/95) added case of polyword
;;     (1/24/99) added referential-category to etypecase of Decode-exp-as-ref-category
;;      to handle ordinals as values. 
;; 0.5 (7/4) hacked Decode-category-specific-binding-instr-exps to notice
;;      the case of the binding instructions already being interpreted.
;;      (a messy job that could be redone: see numbers;form2)
;;     (2/7/05) Added a variant entry point that arranges to have the result formatted
;;      as a plist rather than an alist. (3/16) Added psi case to Decode-exp-as-ref-category
;;     (3/31) Hacked Decode-value-for-var/list to accept word specifications
;;      that include special-case morphology.
;;     (1/9/07) Tweaked Decode-value-for-primitive-v/r since Allegro doesn't support fixnump
;;     (6/19/09) Fan-out from lexical treatment of variables.
;;     (12/6/10) Turned break in decode/check-value into sort of a cerror
