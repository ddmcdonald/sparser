;; initiated 8/9/94 v2.3.  Tweeking ...8/18.  9/28 Added capacity to look for op
;; off of superc.   4/19/95 wrapped gates around the breaks
;; 1/11/11 Patched unindex-individual to not assume that the category has
;; and operations (DM&P issue). 2/7/13 Found case of a category assigned to lists
;; having a hash-table. Put in a throw so reclamation can continue.
