;;;  version:  1.4 March 2007

;; initiated 7/16/92 v2.3
;; 0.1 (11/23) Tweeked an internal call w/in Define-individual to fit lower change
;;      in argument pattern.
;; 0.2 (5/15/93) Added Throw-away individuals as an interim measure in lieu
;;      of revising the indexing and having composite categories etc.
;; 0.3 (5/25) added capacity to instantiate rules off individuals that
;;      provide concrete values for words given schematically in their categories
;; 0.4 (6/7) put in some variations on the calling syntax
;;     (6/19) fixed but in adding subtypes
;; 0.5 (1/10/94) renamed Make-throw-away-individual to Make-trivial-individual
;;     (7/13) wrote Make-an-individual  (8/8) tweeked comments
;; 0.6 (9/28) setup to flush calls to def-individual since it didn't use the
;;      resource for individuals
;; 0.7 (11/5) fixed assumption about the order of items on the plist in define-individual
;; 0.8 (4/20/95) sharpening protocol for permanent individuals
;;     (5/13) continued that by refining the call that produced the object, and
;;      added a wrapper.
;; 0.9 (9/19) changed Make-an-individual to use make/permanent-individual
;; 1.0 (9/7/98) made over Make/individual to use psi
;; 1.1 (10/26) revised Make/individual to allow some old simple cases by or'ing in
;;      Make-trivial-saturated-individual.
;;     (1/24/99) fixed bug in Saturated-form-on-primitives about v/r.
;;     (6/12/99) added saturated-simple-index to the criteria for making individuals
;;     (9/30) Added yet another case: sets-a-name-slot
;; 1.2 (10/10) Changed the policy in Define-individual that anything, anytime that it
;;      creates is to be permanent (can't reconstruct the old rational from 1995, but
;;      left it there.  (12/25) tweaked Only-slot-is-Word to take only the category
;;      since it was being used elsewhere and didn't use bindings.
;; 1.3 (8/27/00) Changed binding-instructions-saturate-slots? to remove its assumption
;;      that the slots have to have primitives as their value restrictions. 
;;     (4/10/03) Problem with reclaimation of compound numbers like 92.7 motivated
;;      backing away from 1.2 policy and reverted to the original notion. Depends
;;      on the initial loader marking all individuals created up to that point as
;;      permanent. 
;;     (2/2/05) Removed the "temporary" from Make-unindexed-individual. Added another
;;      way to override the inclination to make a psi: instances-of-this-category-can-be-partial
;;      which is motivated by ordinals. (2/3) Flushed that. Broke out the criteria for
;;      simple-individuals so it could be used in the find routine. (2/4) Extended 
;;      define-individual to dispatch if it gets a psi where it expected a category name.
;;      (2/7) Added subtype-individual - see Corresponding-unit-of-subtype. (2/8) Debugged
;;      a case in the trivially saturated test.  (2/11) fixed bug with multiple realization
;;      schema where only the first one was being seen. (3/15) to fix the problems with
;;      ordinals (positions in sequences) being gratuitously psi when they're fully defined
;;      added The-missing-slots-are-primitive to the criteria for making individuals.
;;      (4/1) Another case of the shape of the realization-data.
;; 1.4 (3/19/07) Added an optional 'force-new' parameter to make/individual to handle the 
;;      case where an identical description in fact denoted a different individual.
