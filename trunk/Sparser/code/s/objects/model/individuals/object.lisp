;; initiated 7/16/92 v2.3
;; (6/8/93) added Indiv-typep
;; (8/7/94) added itypep as respelling of Indiv-typep and i-type-of
;; 0.1 (3/3/95) modified i-type-of to not break if it is passed an object
;;      other than an individual
;; 0.2 (9/13) extended indiv-typep to look up the lattice
;; 0.3 (8/14/13) Since itypep may be used in cases where its argument
;;      is a category (head word) rather than an individual, added a
;;      diversion for that case.
