;; initiated 7/20/92 v2.3. 8/10/94 redid definition of re-initialization
;; 10/3 added return-from a failure break
;; 1.0 (5/13/95) Added notion of a permanent individual that appears on a separate
;;      list and isn't recycled.  2/7/05 Added permanent-individual? and a value
;;      for the :permanent property
;;     (6/3/13) Moved in the other general {+,-}permanent code and added doc.
;;     (1/10/15) made indiv-uid more robust since it's about to be used more

(in-package :sparser)

#|  This is a recycled heap -based resource, rather than an array
 that wrapps.  This is because we potentially need *all* the individuals
 we might see in the course of a long article, rather than with edges
 or positions where the extent of grammatical relations plainly has
 a limit.  |#

#|
Whether an individual is permanent or reclaim-able is determined by
the call from define-individual, where the *index-under-permanent-instances*
flag is set and read by make-simple-individual. Permanent individuals
are done with calls to make-a-permanent-individual just below and just
'make' a new instance of the structure. Reclaim-able are done by calls
to allocate-individual.

The usual progression of indexing calls for permanent individuals is
index-aux/individual => index-to-category => add-permanent-individual

Regardless of what the category may say about indexing, that function
uses the two-lists on the plist conception of how things are done.
