;;;  version:  1.2 February 2005

;; initiated 7/16/92 v2.3
;; 0.1 (11/10) fixing the semantics of some cases of the find operation
;; 0.2 (11/23) adjusted how it passed arguments to simplify things
;;     (6/12/93) added define-or-find-individual to vary arg. pattern
;; 0.3 (10/22) allowed a category to be passed to Find-individual as well
;;      as symbols naming them since find/individual needs its bindings 
;;      in a list
;;     (1/30/94) added find/individual/seq-keys/both by obvious c&s
;; 0.4 (5/24) fixed long-standing bug in find/indiv of hashed keys
;; 1.0 (9/28) Added capacity to look for op for Find off of superc.
;; 1.1 (8/24/98) Removing that capacity as a trigger for using psi.
;;     (2/14/99) Tweaked find/individual to allow for categories without
;;      operations fields. 
;; 1.2 (2/3/05) revised find/individual to go to psi search if the make operation
;;      would have yielded a psi
