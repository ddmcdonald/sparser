;; initiated 7/16/92 v2.3
;; 0.1 (11/10) fixing the semantics of some cases of the find operation
;; 0.2 (11/23) adjusted how it passed arguments to simplify things
;;     (6/12/93) added define-or-find-individual to vary arg. pattern
;; 0.3 (10/22) allowed a category to be passed to Find-individual as well
;;      as symbols naming them since find/individual needs its bindings 
;;      in a list
;;     (1/30/94) added find/individual/seq-keys/both by obvious c&s
;; 0.4 (5/24) fixed long-standing bug in find/indiv of hashed keys
;; 1.0 (9/28) Added capacity to look for op for Find off of superc.
;; 1.1 (8/24/98) Removing that capacity as a trigger for using psi.
;;     (2/14/99) Tweaked find/individual to allow for categories without
;;      operations fields. 
;; 1.2 (2/3/05) revised find/individual to go to psi search if the make operation
;;      would have yielded a psi. 3/28/13 Patched find-simple-list to
;;      recover from one-off cases
;; 1.3 (6/13/13) Changed define-or-find-individual to use define-individual
;;      rather than make/individual so that it respects the realization
;;      data on the category.
;;     (11/13/13) Improved error msg in find/individual/key/hash
;; 6/5/2015 DAVID!! There is an error that shows up in find/individual/seq-keys 
;; in which 'instances' which is supposed to be an alist of alists ((instances (cat-instances category)))
;; ends up as #<hyphenated-triple 131414> during the parse of
;;"The latter group includes RBPs such as human antigen R (HuR), 
;; AU-binding factor 1 (AUF1), nucleolin and T-cell intracellular antigen (TIA)-1 
;; and TIA-1-related (TIAR) proteins, which associate 
;; with subsets of target mRNAs and modulate their stability and/or translation rates ( xref , xref )."
;; 6/8/2015 Diagnostics for edge-referents which are CONS cells --
;;  break is controlled by parameter *diagnose-consp-referents*
;; 1.4 6/27/15 Now includes *description-lattice* cases
