;; initiated 7/20/92 v2.3
;; (6/4/93) tweeked the checks for valid values in Index/binding
;; (1/7/94) added Binding-of-bindings. allowed bindings to be done to categories
;; 0.1 (4/29) refined Index/binding and left a stub. (8/8) added Bound-as
;;      Continued tweeking ...8/19
;; 0.2 (1/7/96) added Unindex/binding and subrs.
;;     (3/4/05) added optional to Index/binding to just index the value

#|  7/20/92
    Bindings are either permanent or temporary.  If temporary, they
 are stored in the binding-resource and are allocated and deallocated.
 If permanent, there is no such global pointer to all of them.

    Bindings are pointed to by the "binds" fields of the individuals
 in their body fields, and the "bound-in" fields of the individuals
 in their value fields.  They are also cross indexed as "instances"
 of their variables.
