;; broken out from [object] file 8/12/94. Added category-p 9/12/98
;; 3/26/00 Added a rnodes field to referential categories.
;; 2/7/05 Added subtyped-category.
;; 11/9/10 Added 'class' field to referential-category. Took it out on the 11th
;;  because even with a full recompile it couldn't access the slot -- was
;;  always declared out of range. 
;; 4/15/14 Moved mix-ins slot to model-category so it gets inherited by
;;  mixin-category as well as referential-category.
;; 5/9/14 Putting some flesh on subtyped-category.

#| This is one way to make a 'derived category' as per the Krisp paper.
   For now the connection to the category it's derived from is just via
   the lattice point, which will be a subtype-lattice-point.  If there
   come to be other ways of synthetically constructing derived categories
   in the course of a parse then there will likely be other typing
   category types like this one.  |#

  ;; Besides the slots from referential and model structures
  ;; we have to remember that we've got symbol and rule-set
  ;; slots from label by way of the vanilla category struct.
  ;; We use the inherited mix-in slot to hold the specializer
  ;; and the lattice-position now holds a subtype-lattice-point.
