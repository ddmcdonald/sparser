;;;   Module:  "objects;model:categories:"
;;;  version:  1.4 August 2013

;; initiated 7/16/92 v2.3
;; 8/5 added call to process rdata, 8/31 gated it by the field having
;; a value.
;; 0.1 (9/1) Changed the source argument to find-or-make 
;;       from :define-category so that it will build a referential-
;;       categoryrather than a simple one.
;; 0.2 (10/13) added form for define-mixin-category
;; 0.3 (5/25/93) added standard specialized printer for individuals
;;      whose categories have words as the values of their criterial variables
;; 0.4 (9/18) added another indexing type: sequential-keys
;; 0.5 (1/7/94) added capability for real bindings
;;     (7/11) added case to Variables-allow-specialized-printer?
;;     (8/8) pulled the indexing code to [index instances]
;; 0.6 (11/1) tweeked Decode-category-to-instantiate to anticipate some of the 
;;      category names already being dereferenced.
;; 0.7 (11/23) changed define-category/expr to look for a non-referential version of
;;      the category and delete it. 
;; 0.8 (4/19/95) simple-categories could slip through via the specialized slot
;;      so wrote Convert-simple-to-referential-category
;; 1.0 (11/28/97) doing lattice points right in Decode-category-parameter-list
;;     (2/24/98) changed the name of that call. 3/3 changed its location.
;;      6/30 changed it yet again: the free variables weren't being set. 
;; 1.1 (12/25/99) modified Decode-category-parameter-list to make indexing
;;      constructors in all cases. 12/27 Decode-category-parameter-list had to
;;      have its call for constructors ordered before the rdata setup in order for
;;      the 'instantiates' trick in noun-creating rules to work right.
;;     (2/8/05) Added define-subtype-derived-category
;; 1.2 (11/9/10) folded in optional CLOS class creation.
;;     (8/21/11) Fixed bug in decode-category-to-instantiate
;; 1.3 (9/6/11) Added rule-label field to over-ride the default. 
;; 1.4 (8/26/13) Added mixins keyword to decode-category-parameter-list.
