;; initated 11/9/10. Modified the storage scheme 11/11. Tweaking cases
;; through 12/6. 6/16/11 fixed case of clash with existing classes.
;; 9/1/11 Tried a scheme for making instances of each class at the moment
;; the class is defined but it triggered a MOP issue on the first instance
;; of a subclass. 9/3 simplified the names by using a different package
;; and flushed the check to see if the class already exists, which made
;; the MOP problem go away.
