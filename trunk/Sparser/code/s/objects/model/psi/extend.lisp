;; initiated 11/29/97. First given any content 7/7/98. 2/14/99 canonicalized
;; the find call.  2/4/05 Adding some generality - motivated by the call in
;; Spread-sequence-across-ordinals. 2/11/05 Added add-binding-to
;; 0.1 (2/22/07) Modified Make-psi-for-bindings/extend-existing-psi to pass through
;;      the starting-psi if there are no bindings. 3/19 Added special: 
;;      *force-new-psi* to handle the case where an identical description in fact 
;;      denoted a different individual.

;;;------------------------------------
;;; macro for binding variables on psi
;;;------------------------------------

; With an individual, one would call bind-variable and the binding would be
; a side-effect that doesn't touch your local varables. But with psi, the
; act of binding a variable returns a different psi than the one you started
; with. (See bind-v+v within bind-variable.)  This macro makes that transparent
; by incorporating the update on the variable your using to point to the psi

(defmacro add-binding-to (variable-for-i/p variable-name value)
  `(setq ,variable-for-i/p 
         (bind-variable ,variable-name ,value ,variable-for-i/p)))

; A flaw is that a function incorporating this will report that
; the variable you ue to point to the value is 'unused'.
