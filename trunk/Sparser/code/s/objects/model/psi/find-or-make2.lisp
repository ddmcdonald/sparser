;;;  version:  0.1 July 2007

;; These get called during an analysis and make calls out to annotation.

;; initiated 9/12/98. 3/26/00 Modified Find-or-make-psi-for-base-category
;; to pass the category through to the annotator so the rnode can be
;; cross-indexed against it. 4/10 Not so sure we should be annotating the
;; category rather than the psi and it's lattice point.
;; 0.1 (2/2/05) Removing the annotation calls for the nonce, e.g. Find-or-make-psi-for-base-category
;;  (2/3) Fixed the find call in Find-or-make-psi. (2/4) Adding entry point
;;  that starts with a psi.  2/7 Fixed bug in parameter order in the subtype-
;;  creating call: Corresponding-unit-of-subtype. Set up machinery for to create
;;  the psi that goes with the subtyped individual. Tweeked through 2/9.
;;  (7/6/07) Added package expersion because Allegro doesn't appear to be reading
;;  the mode line for meta-.
;; 2.0 (6/19/09) Cleared out uncalled dead wood.
;; 2.1 (7/22) Revising the algorithms of the routines with nice names.
;;     (8/25) Added cases for multiple binding threads reaching the same psi
