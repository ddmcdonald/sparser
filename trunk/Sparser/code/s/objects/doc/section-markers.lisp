;;;  Version:  1.5 May 1994

;; 1.1 (5/21/92 v2.2) Changed the presumptions about what data structure
;;     goes into the "full name" field
;; 1.2 (6/26) fixed Section-marker-named to use sm-
;; 1.3 (7/13) changed the value saved in the rule set from the initiate
;;     fn to the object itself (initiate was motivated by sgml, but was 
;;     short-sighted and doesn't hack it for paragraphs)
;; 1.4 (1/13/94) Fixed bug in installation of the completion action
;; 1.5 (5/3) tweeked def-form to get implicit-close right
