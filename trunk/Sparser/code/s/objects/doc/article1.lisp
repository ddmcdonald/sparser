;; initiated 12/15/93 v2.3
;; c.f. grammar/rules/context/article.lisp for some similar notions
;;   but it's point was to provide 'context' for things like date
;;   references. This is to describe facts about the article per se. 
;; 1.0 (7/23/10) Unclear that this code was used in recent memory since
;;   it's not in a current grep. So bumped the filename and reworked it
;;   as a CLOS object to support tf/idf work in word frequencies
;;   (see grammar/rules/words/frequency.lisp)
;;   (8/21/10) Reworked the fields to be more useful in TF/IDF.
