;; initiated 10/91
;; 0.1  (10/21 v2.0) Bumped [section] to "1".  Added [SGML tags]
;;      (6/18/92 v2.2) added [context]
;; 0.2  (12/7/93 v2.3) added [header label], moved [article] to grammar 12/15
;;      (5/20/94) added [marker pairs].  5/21 added [invisible markup] and
;;       [tag interiors].  6/6 added [annotation].
;; 0.3 (8/17) renamed [sections1] as [section markers], added [sections]
;; 0.4 (1/9/95) bumped [section markers].  9/19 added [html]
;; 0.5 (7/27/10) Added [article1]. The file article has been in the system
;;      forever (1993), but grep doesn't find anything that lloads it.
;;    (9/2/12) added [doc-set] and [word-freq]. (2/28/13) added [content]
;;    (3/14/13) moved the text-relations package here. 4/1 reordered to me
;;     dependency imposed by doc-set  (5/1/13) Moved globals first so all the
;;     symbols are known before they're referenced in code.
;; 0.6 (7/15/13) Bumped [object] to 1 to start adjustments for greater uniformity
;;      in accumulators and operations. Added [classes]. (9/18/13) added
;;      [situation]. 10/3/13 moved out [situation].
;;     (1/26/15) added [sentence-corpora]
