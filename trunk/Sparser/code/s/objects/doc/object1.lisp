;; Created 2/6/13 to solve the problem of keeping document/section context.
;; [sfriedman:20130206.2038CST] I'm writing this using /objects/chart/edges/object3.lisp as an analog.
;; 3/29/13 hooked articles into document-set.
;; 1.0 (7/15/13) Bumped to add sentence and to get more uniformity on
;;      operations like noting and operations on contents.
;;     (9/23/13) Pretty much finished with the make-over except for occasional fanout.
;; 1.1 (10/3/13) Making paragraphs real. Lifting out the generalization
;;     (10/26/13) Added word-frequency mixin to article. What about the others?
;;     (4/9/14) Moved in the get-document code from objects/doc/article1 so that
;;      some older code is happy. 
;; 1.2 Adding print methods and tweaking initializations to accommodate
;;      read-from-document through 4/27/15
;;     4/28/15 added section-of-sections
;;     6/14/15 Added a sentence to title-text. 7/2/15 Added iniform nil
;;     to a few cases that didn't have it already.
