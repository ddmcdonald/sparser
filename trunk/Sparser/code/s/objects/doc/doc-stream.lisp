;; 1.1 (4/15 v1.8.3)  Rethreaded the test against whether the file exists
;;     so that if it didn't we'd just not get a definition of the stream,
;;     rather than it blocking.
;; 1.2 (3/19 v2.2) Redoing bits as part of setting up the menus. Added
;;     possibility of a doc stream being composed of doc streams.
;; 1.3 (12/7/93 v2.3) updated handling of logicals, 12/13 fixed glitch that
;;      had kept stream with substreams from being recorded. 
;; 1.4 (12/27) Made styles real
;;     (1/3/94) fixed a bug
;; 1.5 (1/26) added the field for 'menu-item'
;; 1.6 (3/30) added requirement that there be a style

#|  At the moment there are no real-time sources.  If there were, they
would probably be connected to the Engine via character streams.  As it
stands, the text must be already stored on the system somewhere.

   Provision is made here for pre-defined and stored sequences of
documents so that they can be analyzed as a body in a single, uninterrupted
run.  This is convenient for demonstrations and for replicating tests
across a uniform corpus.


   A "document stream" can be given as the argument to Analyze-all-
 logical formdocuments-in-stored-source .

   This routine expects a stipulation of the style, which is recorded 
in a field of the object, and of either a directory (where all of the files
are processed: one file is one article), or a list of explicit file names.
