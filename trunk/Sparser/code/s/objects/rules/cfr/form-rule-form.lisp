;;;   Version:   0.4 March 2005

;; initiated 9/3/92 v2.3, 
;; 0.1 (10/12) formulated better now that it's getting used
;;     (5/12/93) Added subroutines that had been left out
;; 0.2 (6/1) Revised it pretty heavily with extra subroutines and a
;;      provision to allow explicit lhs when called from a rule schema
;; 0.3 (2/24/98) added a reference to the global schema that created
;;      the rule to Construct-form-cfr.
;; 0.4 (3/10/05) Adjusted treatment of new-category in Def-form-rule/resolved
;;      to accomodate a new pattern in etf.
