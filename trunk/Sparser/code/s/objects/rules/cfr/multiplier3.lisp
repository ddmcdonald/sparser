;; 3.0 (9/4/92 v2.3) Tweeked things to appreciate form rule ids
;;     (10/12) fixed typos
;; 3.1 (12/21) allowed Establish-multiplier to permit lists as the
;;      value of multiplications if the flag is set that way
;; 3.2 (3/8/93) updated Disable-cfr to handle form ids too
;; 3.3 (3/15/94) tweeked Establish-multiplier to be more sensitive to the
;;      duplication flags
;; 3.4 (4/24/95) the order of args in the call to Duplication-msg was wrong now.
;;     (10/25) changed the name of the duplicate dotted rules flag
