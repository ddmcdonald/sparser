;;;   Version:   1.5 May 2014

;; 1.1 (5/2/92 v2.2) Added short-forms
;; 1.2 (9/3 v2.3) added cases for referential categories and (9/7) for
;;      mixin categories
;; 1.3 (10/12) added case for form rules
;;     (6/15/93) tweeked it.
;; 1.4 (12/1/94) adjusted the menu version to new menu treatment
;; 1.5 (6/20/95) made the menu printer sensitive to the version in the grammar menu
;;     (2/14/98) added symbol case to Princ-rule-term so it could be used 
;;      for the cases in tree families. (3/16/12) quiet the compiler
;;     (5/16/14) cleaned up some ecases.
