;;;    Module:   "objects;rules:cfr:"
;;;   Version:   5.2 March 2007

;; initiated November 1990 (v1.5)
;; 4.0 (9/4/92 v2.3) Cleaned up a bit to fit other cleanups
;;     (10/23) changed how dotted rule categories are indexed to their
;;      grammar modules.
;; 4.1 (3/8/93) Modified the algorithm to make the way it handles multiple
;;      completions sensible.
;; 4.2 (5/6) fixed a conceptualization bug in that
;;     (8/25) added Edge-of-dotted-intermediary
;; 5.0 (3/15/94) Tweeked def. of 'dotted-rule', and added sensitivity to
;;      duplication flags within Make-dotted-rule. 3/15 wrote Dotted-category
;; 5.1 (10/25/95) Thought through the patterning of dotted rules when
;;      "chief executive" had been being preempted by "chief executive officer"
;;      as a duplicate rule. Fixed the algorithm so that they now work, but
;;      left a stub in Make-dotted-rule for a case that seems possible but which
;;      I can't set up and which isn't used in the current grammar.
;;     (1/5/96) added Dotted-rule? and Source-of-dotted-rule
;;     Trivially tweaked 2/16/98 to bump the fasl for new source.
;; 5.2 (3/7/07) Got the case that hadn't previously presented itself and
;;      used the commented out call to make-dotted-rule1 in the chance that
;;      I wrote that in 1995 with a good understanding of the whole process
;;      and the assumption that it would work but wanted to leave in the
;;      note/Stub.
