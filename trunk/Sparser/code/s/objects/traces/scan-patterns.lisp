;; initiated 10/6/95. Added/modified 7/11/96 through 7/12.
;; 3/5/07 Added cases to go with simpler treatment of no-space sequences.
;; 4/19/15 added trace to record there being white space before the ps
;; Gradually adding more through 7/18/15. Lifted out the no-space cases
;; to analyzers/psp/patterns/traces.lisp 7/21/15.
