;;;  Version:  1.4 February 2015

;; 1.0 (10/5/92 v2.3) added trace routines
;; 1.1 (4/23/93) added still more to go with the revised protocol
;; 1.2 (6/14) tweeked msgs and added more routines to fit brackets
;;      adjustments
;; 1.3 (9/14) added more routines to track down why digit sequences are off
;; 1.4 (5/6/94) put in network-flow traces. 5/12 added more, or'd in some cases
;;      with *trace-brackets* and *trace-segments*. 7/12 another such case
;;     (7/26) extended with cases for edges returned by fsas
;;     ... 10/31 adding lots of cases for forest and treetop operations
;;     (1/5/95) added bracket traces for the [-on..? check. 1/23 they needed
;;      another case.
;;     (4/24) added some variants for Adjudicate-new-open-bracket
;;     (5/4) added more network cases.  5/19 added da cases
;;     (7/12) added more network-flow traces. (3/17/05) fixed case statements.
;;     (2/13/07) added traces for conjunction/TT transition.
;;     (5/30/09) added traces for verb+prep combination
;;     (6/2/10) added traces for new conditions in scan.
;;     (12/14/10) fixed capitalization bugs  (11/2/12) added PNF-resetting-open-bracket
;;      Continued adding and tweaking through 12/5/12. 
;;     (2/10/13) added trace-status-history. Bracket variant 4.1.13
;;     (5/12/14) Bunch of C3 traces. 8/31/14 Moved forest traces out to forest.
;;     Adding traces for the new code through 10/22/14
;;     (2/8/15) traces for trace-terminals-loop
