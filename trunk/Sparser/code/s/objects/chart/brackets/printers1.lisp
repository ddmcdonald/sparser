;; 1.1 (4/26/91 v1.8.4)  Reworked to use bracket symbols
;; 1.2 (11/24/92 v2.3) Added a routine for printing segments on successive lines
;; 1.3 (4/27/93) adjusting segment printer to new word-level protocol
;; 1.4 (12/15) extended Display-bracked-segments to hack a wrapped chart and
;;      stoped it from looping when the analysis wasn't finished
;;     (1/4/95) extended distance Display-chart-brackets printed by one
