;; 1.1 (4/25/91 v1.8.4)  Reworked to separate the indexing of the brackets
;;      from their assignment to particular words.
;;     (1/13/92 v2.2)  Put in Scott's changes to the macros
;;     (12/17/92 v2.3) added some comentary
;;     (5/24/94) cleaned it up
;; 1.2 (6/19/96) revised the macros so that the just returned a single expression,
;;      which now lets them compile. 6/25 fixed a bug in it.
;;     (7/31/11) add an assign fn for all the brackets on a word pulled from
;;      define-function-word.
