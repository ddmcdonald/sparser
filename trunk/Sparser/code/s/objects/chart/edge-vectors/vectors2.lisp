;;;  Version:  2.2 September 2013

;; 2.0 (11/26/92 v2.3) bumped on general principles anticipating changes.
;; 2.1 (4/6/93) Put in switch for kcons vs. vector versions
;; 2.2 (4/1/94) added remove-edge-from-chart
;;     (7/30/13) Added a set of function to lift up the fringe of an
;;      established edge, where one of its edges has been composed
;;      (to the right) with another edge, and reknit everything together
;;      properly. 9/19/13 moved the new stuff to objects/chart/edge-vectors/
;;      tuck. 9/23/13 added cleanup-vectors-if-needed
