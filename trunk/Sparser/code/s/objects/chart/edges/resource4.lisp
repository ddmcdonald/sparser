;; 3.0 (9/7/92 v2.3) updated the references to edge fields
;; 3.1 (4/7/93) changed name to Make-the-edge-resource for ease of documentation
;; 3.2 (8/1/94) added *left-most-edge-valid-position* and started cleaning up
;; 4.0 (1/24/95) inserted a call to long-term-ify/individual.
;;     (1/1/96) getting problems with it. (1/14-16) working on the problems,
;;      Grossly remodularized the routine.  (5/30) debugging that.
