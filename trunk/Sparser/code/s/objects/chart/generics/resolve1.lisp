;;;   Version:   1.5 August 2011

;; 1.1 (10/31 v2.0.1) Changed Resolve/make to do a Resolve first, and
;;     moved over the symbol resolutions
;; 1.2 (1/15/92 v2.2) moved the word resolving code to objects;words
;; 1.3 (2/20) Added "source" parameter for cataloging
;;     (7/19 v2.3) moved in resolve.../check
;; 1.4 (10/12) Added Resolve-form-label
;; 1.5 (8/31/11) Added a typecase over all the regular objects I could
;;      think of. This simplifies using def-cfr/expr from code when
;;      you already have the objects.
