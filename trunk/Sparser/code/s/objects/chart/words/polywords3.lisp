;;;   Module:  "objects;chart:words:"
;;;  Version:  3.3 April 2009

;; 1.1 (1/18/91 v1.8)  Added a proper Display-polyword that didn't use
;;      bracketing double quotes -- Princ-polyword does that.
;; 1.2 (10/31 v2.0) Flushed the polyword package - shifted the constant
;;      to use the word package.
;; 2.3 (9/6/92 v2.3) Added not-all-same-character-type as the better
;;      check for a string being a polyword than the recursive call to
;;      the tokenizer (sort of a poor-man's tokenizer that get's the
;;      semantics without the deliniation).  9/21 fleshed out the definition.
;; 3.0 (7/16/93) updated field name inside words
;; 3.1 (12/7) updated what has to be removed when deleting a pw
;; 3.2 (4/27/94) changed the return value of princ-polyword to mulify pretty-print-individual
;;     (12/19) added multi-word check and string constructor
;; 3.3 (6/2/08) Fan-out for *force-case-shift* ("United States")
;;     (4/14/09) added hyphenated-string-for-pw
