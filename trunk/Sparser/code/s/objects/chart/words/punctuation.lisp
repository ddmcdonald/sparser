;; originally written in June 1990
;; 0.0 (4/23/91 v1.8.4)  Minor tweek to make sure it doesn't overrun an
;;      already existing rule-set
;; 0.1 (9/26/92 v2.3) added punctuation-named
;; 0.2 (10/16) Added special proclamations for the new symbols and a return
;;      value that shows you what symbols it created
;; 0.3 (9/25/93) added data-check to def. routine
;;     (7/19/94) added Punctuation? 3/15/13 Putting a guard on it since
;;      it's going to be used more broadly and not just passed words
;; 0.4 (7/30/14) Simplified definition of punctuation?
;; 3/21/2015 SBCL caught major time and cons waster -- punctuation-named -- revised so as not to use cons and intern
