;;;     File:  "polyword form"
;;;   Module:  "objects/chart/words:"
;;;  Version:  2.0 June 2015

;;  0.1  Changed the definition of the symbol for polywords to be the
;;       string in vertical bars rather than the equivalent uppercase
;;       symbol.
;;  0.2  (v1.6, 12/12/90)  Re-examined the algorithm to get a clean notion
;;       of a polyword object that can be interned even though it isn't
;;       anymore thought of as a kind of word that is recognized by
;;       scanning the output of Next-token.
;;  1.0 (10/5/92 v2.3) Made substantial changes to bring it into the modern era
;;  1.1 (10/28/93 v2.3) added data check
;;  1.2 (9/6/94) for some reason some pws are being defined as words.
;;       Added a check for this in the case of redefinition.
;;      (12/16) added define-polyword/from-words
;;  1.3 (6/2/08) Fan-out for *force-case-shift* ("United States")
;;      (3/1/12) quiet compiler
;;  1.4 (7/30/14) Made an exception to the 'must be different character
;;       type check for the case of punctionation. Word-around for two
;;       single quotes being used for double quote in uniform-scan.
;;  2.0 (5/19/15) For make-over to a state machine.
;;      (6/7/15) Removed define-polyword/from-words because nothing has
;;       called it since the make-over. If something from another grammar
;;       module does then can adapt to it then.
