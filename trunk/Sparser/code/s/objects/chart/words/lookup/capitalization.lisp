;;;  Version:  0.3 January 1996

;; initiated 10/90
;; 0.1 (11/23/92 v2.3) Revised slightly to appreciate the case where the
;;      word being defined is a digit-sequence.
;; 0.2 (8/27/93) added routine for picking the variant on a word that
;;      fits the capitalization it has in that instance
;; 0.3 (5/5/94) brought in a variation on that and a subsuming variant routine
;;     (5/10) fixed a missing case in it   (8/7) added Capitalized-instance
;;     (10/20) added the capability of constructing a new word to fit a given
;;       simple capitalization pattern.  (10/24) cleaned up Capitalized
;;     (4/19/95) added Find-or-make/capitalized-word-to-fit-position
;;     (5/18) added Word-at-this-position-is-lowercase?.  ...caps? on 5/19
;;     (12/31) added a case to Subsuming-variant. And again 1/16/96
