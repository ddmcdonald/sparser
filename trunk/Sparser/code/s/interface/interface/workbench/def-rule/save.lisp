;; broken out of [define-rule] 4/27/95.  6/14 extended to have words in the 
;; mapping.  
;; 0.1 (7/28) tweeked the args passed via the funcall in rdt/Save-new-rule
;; 0.2 (8/28) parameterized the choice of dossier.  11/16 added an announcement
;;      of what had happened. (12/5) finished the announcement stuff
;;     (3/14) fixed typo in that.  (6/26/96) checked a pending breakpoint and
;;      removed it.
