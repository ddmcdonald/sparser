;;;---------
;;; Time
;;;--------- 

;;sparser does not label or interpret "a.m." or "p.m." notations

;;sparser does not give labels for seasons, i.e. summer, fall/autumn, winter, spring

;;weekdays are still rule labeled as both weekday and time, should only be labeled as time

;;no labels for relative time adverbials like "recent(ly)", "lately", "as of late", etc.

;;times like "nine (at night)" are parsed as numbers, rather than similar "9 o'clock"

;;how does "during" work when combined with events, rather than explicit times?  
;;this is not yet handled by Sparser, at least from a compositional perspective.  
;;Is "during the storm" a time phrase (anchors another event overlapping with "the storm")?
;;Or is it simply some kind of adjunct (but then again all time phrases are adjunct-like)? 

;;what about "while?" or "for" (e.g. "for twenty minutes")
;;note that "during" and "while" have no common complements
;;"while" requires some kind of verb phrase, while "during" allows for NP like complements

#|(define-citation "while"
  (SEQUENCER, WHILE))|#

;;what about 
;;"in the course of" (polyword?)
;;"in the midst of" (polyword?)
;;"in the middle of" (polyword?)
;;etc.  
;;all of which seem to be in the same semantic neighborhood as "during" or "while"

;;;---------
;;; dates

;;simple year parsing
;;note that it parsers 2011 and greater as a number and not a year

(define-citation "2010"

;;simple date parsing
;;note that for dates written with overt ordinal marking, e.g. "October 3rd"
;;sparser tokenizes the derivational morphology but does not give it a label
;;"October 1st" and "October 1" should be the same.  

(define-citation "October 1"
  (1 DATE 3))

;;date with comma-year, standard notation

;;season with year works as date, but do we want to call this a date?
