;;;  version:  0.18 January 2013

;; initiated 4/1/94 v2.3
;; 0.1 (4/23) fixed change of where :literal-in-a-rule is in Sort-out-multiple-
;;      preterminals-for-pnf. Added case for single-capitalized-word in Examine...,
;;       and for literals.
;; 0.2 (5/2) fixing interpretation of initials so that a seq. of just initials is not
;;      taken as a person.  6/13 added check with ordinals that if it isn't in
;;      last position we just call the sequence a 'name', added check for function
;;      words.  6/14 added the flag.  Changed Def- to Define-individual
;; 0.3 (12/7) rearranged the order of tests w/in the :word case so particular words
;;      can be checked w/o their having to be mentioned in rules: fixes bug w/ "&"
;;     (1/16/95) added 'country'
;;     (2/23) added person-versions
;; 0.4 (4/13) added Occurs-in-names facility to avoid always extending the Cond
;;     (4/19) made adjustments to fit name-word changes. (4/23) made company names
;;      done by a subr just like person names
;; 0.5 (4/30) flushed company-generalization-word in favor of a name-word with
;;      :heuristic-company-word on its plist. 
;; 0.6 (5/2) tweeking name constructor re. "and".  ...5/11 tweeking and, of, etc.
;; 0.7 (5/15) changed the return value in those cases to include the pos. after
;;     (5/29) added "The" as internal evidence for companies
;; 0.8 (5/29) fixed a problem with "...of <city>"
;; 0.9 (7/5) added case for initial 'OF', which leads to 'no items' condition
;; 0.10 (7/7) reworked treatment of ordinals to fit in as person-versions
;;      (8/9) Refined :flush-suffix check for inc-terms. Gave 'the' a prefix 
;;       detector.
;; 0.11 (10/30) updated call to make person names to hack 'and'
;; 0.12 (12/4) tweeked treatment of person-versions  
;; 0.13 (12/29) tweeked treatment of titles.   (12/31) added an ad-hoc case
;;       to the Sort-out-multiple-preterminals-for-pnf thread
;; 0.14 (1/1/96) added section-marker as an edge referent possibility in 
;;       Referents-of-list-of-edges. Added to Reason-to-terminate-name-at-and? the
;;       case of 'and' being first in the sequence.
;; 0.15 (1/16) added co-activity as internal evidence.
;; 0.16 (6/18) removed "the" as a direct rationale for a company in Categorize-and-
;;       form-name.
;;      ---  Somewhere in there the monster loop was converted to flet's w/o a
;;       record of why.
;;      (6/21/07) Dealt with case of sentence-initial "an" (6/26) added 'word' as a
;;       possible 'referent' in Referents-of-list-of-edges. (7/6) for the case of a
;;       sentence-initial "the" (but we don't seem to be paying any attention to that)
;;       hacked the uncategorized-name case in Categorize-and-form-name to pop off
;;       any initial words in items that have rule sets.
;;      (11/13/08) Encountered "Bernard/Orleans" which ran into a break about whether
;;       to push the word onto the item list. Added a (unused) flag 'slash' to record
;;       this so we could potentially split it up again given evidence for it.
;;       (2/14/11) "Business Factory" was causing a parser design-limit reached error, with an infinite loop in examine-capitalized-sequence, so I added a line to walk through multiple-treetops properly to fix it. - cfg
;; 0.17 (8/11 -- 9/5/11) Added internal evidence for names that refer to locations
;;       e.g. "Benedict Pond". 10/3 Needs a heuiristic for "South Lee". 
;; 0.18 (11/6) removed the "The" check and removal from uncategorized names because
;;       is was written too broadly and sweeping up things it shouldn't have.
;;      (12/19/11) Adding "Hurricane" by analogy to how place names are done.
;;       Tweaking little things in lieu of a big makeover through 12/10/12. Fixed
;;       typo in that and finished off stub 1/18/13.
