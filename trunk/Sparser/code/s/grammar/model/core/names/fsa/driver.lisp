;; initiated 5/15/93 v2.3, added traces 5/26
;; 0.1 (12/9) Added pre-emptive state variable
;; 0.2 (12/17) added more globals to allow communication between distant
;;      subroutines and driver
;;     (4/4/94) added global var to keep track of the starting position
;;     (7/18) added parameter to control pre-emptive state var.
;; 0.3 (7/21) added status keyword for when PNF is preempted
;; 0.4 (9/28) put in a parameterized toplevel to the driver and added a
;;      scan-only routine
;;     (2/2/95) added a small variation on that scan-only routine
;; 0.5 (2/13) added checks for flags set during the scan for the dm&p cases
;;     (8/17/97) moved *ignore-capitalization* up to [drivers;inits:sessions:globals1]
