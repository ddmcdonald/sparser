;; Initiated 3/28/13 by pulling out the odd tests and checks 
;; from examine. 
;; 0.1 (7/7/13) Rewrote sort-out-multiple-preterminals-for-pnf to prefer
;;      name-words rather than ignore them. Since that was the old policy
;;      there could be repurcussions. 
;; 0.2 (7/22/13) fixed pnf-treetop-at to return nil if its heuristics
;;      don't return something, and tweaked its subroutines, which do need
;;      work.
