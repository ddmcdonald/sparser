;; initiated 5/15/93 v2.3, populated 6/7, added recording of single
;; word names 6/10. added *no-referent-calculations* option 1/6/94.
;; 0.1 (3/8) experimenting with only using the default name creators
;;      and none of the special cases.
;; 1.0 (4/1) completely rearranged as part of new classification design
;;     (10/6) small promulgation of effects to names
;; 1.1 (12/7) added subseq.ref. checks on uncategorized names
;; 1.2 (4/23/95) added quick check for new uncategorized names to avoid the
;;      lengthy subseq.ref. lookup.
;; 1.3 (5/2) added 'collection' case
;; 1.4 (8/14/11) added locations.  Added person-name/first-last and
;;      commented out hurricane to quiet the compiler.
;; 1.5 (2/14/13) Makng named-object's for unccategorized-names.
