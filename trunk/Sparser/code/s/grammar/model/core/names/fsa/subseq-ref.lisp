;;;  version:  0.3 June 2013

;; broken out from [names:fsa:record] 6/8/93 v2.3
;; (1/7/94) patched around earlier indexing bug in Item-in-a-known-name
;; 0.1 (4/3) adding preference for individuals mentioned in the current discourse.
;; 0.2 (10/5) given that the indexing of names switched to just the sequences,
;;      developing an alternative lookup scheme.
;;     (12/7) added another entry point for when the c is in hand
;; 0.3 (12/22) fixed bug in 10/5 work
;;     (2/2/05) switched Subsequent-reference-off-name-word to look at ordinal bindings
;;      rather than position-in-a-sequence
;;     (2/13/13) Added a routine to use machinery like this off a directly
;;      linked name-word. Adapting dereference-proper-noun as well
;;      Rebuild it (item-already-linked-to-entity) while tracking down an infinite loop
;;      on 2/22/13. Fixed basic case (name-of) for person 6/7/13
;;     (6/15/13) Fixed subsequent-reference-off-name-word
;;     (6/17/13) Generalized known-sequence beyond companies.
