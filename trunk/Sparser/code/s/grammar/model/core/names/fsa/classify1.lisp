;;;  version:  1.10 October 2009

;; initiated 5/15/93 v2.3 to fit PNF paper
;; 0.1 (6/10) tweeked judgement over single words
;; 0.2 (6/18) and again -- they need sequence intermediaries for consistency
;;      with all other names
;; 0.3 (6/30) changed the treatment of single word cap.seq. so that it
;;      didn't presume that it was a name.
;;     (10/22) added case there for proper-adjectives  (10/28) filled stub for
;;      two edges over a single capitalized word
;; 0.4 (12/7) added case to handle "AN" ambiguity and stubbed the case of
;;      single unclassified capitalized words
;; 0.5 (1/27/94) broke out the pnf transition driver to [do transitions]
;; 0.6 (3/15) switched where single-edge routine looked to appreciate that an
;;      edge is a literal
;; 0.7 (3/28) tweeked the fields of the edge made by Span-as-capitalized-word
;; 1.0 (4/1) redesigned the algorithm to leave out depenence on the transition network
;;     (5/6) adjusted status terminology
;; 1.1 (5/17) bringing position status into sync with new scheme.
;; 1.2 (6/14) added a case to C&R-single-word  (7/21) added case-initial traces
;; 1.3 (9/28) added routines to handle sentence-start issues (for scan-only protocol)
;;     (10/19) tweeked scan-only's treatment of sentence-initial cases
;;     (11/17) and again.
;; 1.4 (11/23) changed those routines to check one of the returned args and hold off
;;      on making a new edge.
;; 1.5 (1/4/95) installed early-termination catch in scan-only.
;;     (1/23) removed the dm&p thread to [names;fsa:simple classify"
;; 1.6 (5/11) put breaks under *debug-pnf* flag
;; 1.7 (5/15) added Classify&record-the-rest-of-the-sequence
;;     (5/29) tweeked the choice of follow-on call in that
;;     (5/30) added a filter for name-words in single word case
;; 1.8 (10/18) added a case to multiple edges over a single word.
;;     (1/1/96) added a comment for a stub re. missing an "and" trap.
;; 1.9 (1/2) hacked Sortout-edges-over-single-cap-word to take all the non-literal edges
;; 1.10 (7/11) modified C&R-single-word to appreciate the starts of sentences and not
;;       make the words into name-words in that situation.
;;     (2/2/05) Pulled the 'temporary' out of the call in Do-single-word-name
;;     (6/21/07) Stubbed could-be-the-start-of-a-sentence to return nil.
;;     (6/17/08) Declared that the edge created by span-as-capitalized-word
;;      was a proper-name so that downstream tests would have a filled form field
;;      without worring about wanting a richer classification.
;;     (10/12/09) Gave could-be-the-start-of-a-sentence a real definition.
