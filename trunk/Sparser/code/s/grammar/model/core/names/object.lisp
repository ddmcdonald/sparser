;;;  version:  0.1 July 2013

;; initiated 5/28/93 v2.3. Broke name word routines out to their own file 4/20/95. 
;; 0.1 (5/2) added an explicit name-creator to hack "and".   5/12 remodularized
;;  the Find routine
;;  (9/13) added sort routine
;;  (2/4/05) Swapping in the new, psi-oriented, sequence functions. (3/14/05) let
;;  the simple version of Make/uncategorized-name go through. (7/5/07) removed a 
;;  break statement.
;;  (2/8/13) Added names built from no-space pattern. 2/13/13 Added a class
;;   for named-object. Could have been in upper-model, but didn't want
;;   a complication with the restriction of the name variable to name.
;;  (7/4/131) Marked named-object permanent. Put traces in its find/make functions
