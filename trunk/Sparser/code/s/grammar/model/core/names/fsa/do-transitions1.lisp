;;;  version:  1.12 July 2013

;; -.3 (12/17/93) added a catch to handle the fact that the capitalization of
;;      headers will catch them up in the initial scan.  (12/22) fixed a ramification
;;      of all that. 
;; -.2 (12/30) extended fsa driver to filter out literals from multiple edges
;;      over words.
;; -.1 (1/6/94) adding cut-off switch to avoid running the network, etc.
;; 0.0 (1/27/94 v2.3) broken out from [classify]
;; 0.1 (2/24) fixed what is passed as the daughters to a name edge
;; 1.0 (4/1) completely rearranged as part of new classification design
;;     (4/6) more cleanup from that
;; 1.1 (4/23) hacked up defaults for Name-components-of. 4/29 finished the hack
;; 1.2 (7/22) flushed the hack as impossible to improve ///start over
;; 1.3 (10/3) change in args. to make proper-name edge.  10/31 changed default on
;;      break on outside coverage to Nil
;; 1.4 (12/11) tweeked Do-referent-and-edge.
;; 1.5 (4/30/95) added another case to adjudicating what the examine routine
;;      returns.
;; 1.6 (5/2) broke out calculation of edge label in Do-referent-and-edge to handle
;;      names as collections in a nice way.   5/3 put in check for PFWPNF extending
;;      the end position.
;; 1.7 (5/15) changed the early-ending cases to continue with classification 
;;      on the remainder.
;; 1.8 (7/5) added the case of Examine.. returning Nil for 'no items'
;; 1.9 (7/13) changed default on debugging flat to t.
;;     (2/11/05) Updated Do-referent-and-edge to handle psi. (3/4) when the company
;;     ends the text ("for Ajax Company Inc.") we're getting a :suffix-flushed
;;     result in Classify-&-record-span that's actually not going to do anything, so
;;     added a check.
;;    (8/28/09) Extensive case changes (crossed my threshold -ddm). Preping for overhaul
;;    (2/15/11) Added another case to category-for-edge-given-name-type. 7/13 fixed
;;     return (nil instead of the edge) from :suffix-flushed case in classify-&-
;;     record. 8/15 Installed named-location cases. 8/28 Modified do-referent-and-edge
;;     to incorporate "the" preceding location names.
;; 1.10 (2/13/13) Reworked classify-&-record-span to accept named objects and
;;     not just names in what it gets from examine-capitalized-sequence.
;; 1.11 (3/28/13) The outer catch tag in classify-&-record-span not longer appears
;;    in the source, so replaced it with :abort-examination-not-a-name and another
;;    clause for cons results. 5/9/13 Missed a case of name-of-location.
;; 1.12 (528/13) Broke out do-pnf-edge from the do referent and edge so it is
;;    callable directly when the examine process returns a real entity and
;;    not simply a name. 7/3/13 name -> named-object for label on uncharacterized names.
