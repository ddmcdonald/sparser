;; 2.0  (7/20/92 v2.3) made over to use "real" categories
;; 2.1  (10/5) tweeked construct-temporary... to not make a polyword
;; 2.2  (11/23,24) adjusted the calls to find/make individuals to varied form
;; 2.3  (9/16/93) stopped memoizing compound digit sequences
;;      (7/19/94) added Digit? and Digit-sequence?
;; 2.4  (12/22/95) changed an access to a lambda var to make it unambig.
;; 2.5  (6/12/99) changed the code to instantiated multipliers as individuals
;;      (7/4) debugged it.
;; 2.6  (7/18) Did a substantial makeover on Construct-temporary-number so that
;;       it would retain the word that is there when it is called from an
;;       unknown digit sequence -- motivated by nlg.
;;      (9/25) added Find-number
;;      (3/17/00) Added a schema to all the rules for reversibility.
;;      (7/7) Added illions-distributions to construct-number so they'd
;;       slot into the generation specialist.
;; 2.7  (8/24) Drastically reworked the illions-distribution stuff for
;;       the multipliers and the others.
;;      (4/10/03) Getting problem with reclaimation of multi-element numbers 
;;        like "83.97". Added a notion of "temporary? to the various contructors
;;        that's only invoked when we're comming in from construct-temporary-number.
;;      (3/13/13) Gave digit and word numbers adjective brackets.
;; 3.0  (6/28/15) Reorganizing construct-number to define the individual before
;;       defing any of the rules that use it as a referent. 
;;      (7/2/15) Added reify-digit-word to make sure that digit sequences
;;       that weren't predefined are remembered.
