;;;  Version:  2.7 June 2015

;; 2.0  (7/16/92 v2.3) bumped [percentages] to 1 to install new regime
;;      7/19 bumped nearly everything else to make it over to new categories
;; 2.1 (10/5) bumped the digits fsa to change the scan details.
;; 2.2 (9/17/93) bumped it again (to 6) to preserve old counting alg.
;;     (9/18) uncommented [ordinals] and bumped it to 1
;; 2.3 (1/7/94) began breaking out the cases into dossiers.
;; 2.4 (10/13/97) broke out the digits fsa as its own module.
;; 2.5 (7/11/00) bumped ordinals to 2 to rename the base category.
;; 2.6 (2/3/05) bumped ordinals to 3 to sort it out as a coherent individual
;;     (3/29/06) Appeared to have left out the digits fsa in the 2.6 mod.
;;     (8/16/07) added [relation].
;; 2.7 (5/9/13) Moved the two dossier filees in to load here so we can use
;;      them right away. Bumbed form to 3 on 6/28/15 to have a clean
;;      copy while reorganizing the creation of number individuals
;;      and their rules.
