;;;  Version:  3.0 February 2005

;; initiated [ordinals1] 9/18/93 v2.3 as completely new treatment
;; 1.0 (1/7/94) redesigned as specialized categories
;;     (1/9/96) added string printer.
;; 2.0 (7/11/00) Changed the name of the interesting category from position-in-
;;      a-sequence to ordinal, flushing the simple category "ordinal". Reworked
;;      into the new regime as much as possible.
;; 2.1 (7/13) punted on the whole 'each ordinal is its own relation scheme 
;;      since it shouldn' be necessary given psi.
;; 3.0 (2/3/05) Version 2 doesn't appear coherent (asks for categories, defines individuals)
;;      so trying to get it all on the same page. Arranging for it to make individuals rather
;;      than psi. Fixing the nth-ordinal routine.
;; 3.1 (3/15) Reverting to 'position-in-a-sequence' in addition to an object for
;;      simple ordinals -- drops the partial-ness of ordinals and transfers that 
;;      functionality to the new (old) category.

#| It's called 'ordinal' because that's the natural term for the words
   that realize them: "first", "second", etc.  But it's function is more
   complex (/// is this the right thing?), which follows from its previous
   name, position-in-a-sequence, where we are defining a relationship between
   a position, the ordinal proper, and an item, and the sequence in which it
   is the 'ordinal-th' position.  The idea being that when you hear "first"
   you automatically know that there's an item and a sequence.  |#
