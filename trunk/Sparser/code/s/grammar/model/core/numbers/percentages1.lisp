;; 1.1 (7/16/92 v2.3) pilot instances of the new representation regime
;; 1.2 (1/10/94) stubbed measurement to get around load-order paradox
;;     (1/9/96) added string printer
;; 1.3 (7/5/98) redone with a schematic realization.
;;     (9/9/14) added 'n-fold'
;;     (4/20/15) Something odd has happened and the #\% character is
;;      appearing in the chart as the polyword "percent-sign". Added it
;;      to the options for the np-head.
