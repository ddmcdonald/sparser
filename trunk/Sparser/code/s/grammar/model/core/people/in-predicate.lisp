;;this deals with a small set of words preceded by "in" and followed usually by "of"
;;e.g. "in charge of", "in place of", "instead of"
;;unsure if this is a completely closed set
;;these so called in-predicates behave similarly to verbs
;;this shows because the transitive tree family works perfectly for them
;;previously these were parsed as relative-locations (a common overgeneration by the grammar)
;;unsure however where to exactly put this category
;;for now it will be placed in model;core:people:

;;these ones are very predicate like
;;and can be thought to be equivalent to their verbal forms
;;He is in command of = He commands, She is in control of = She controls
;;though there are subtle semantic and pragmatic differences
(define-in-predicate "in charge")

(define-in-predicate "in command")

(define-in-predicate "in control")

;;this one is an outlier, but it patterns similarly to the above
;;e.g. "the country's progress in the field of civilian nuclear technology"
(define-in-predicate "in the field of")

;;these last three are less predicate like than the following
;;and should probably be made into a different category altogether
;;this is apparent because their head words are closer to prepositions
;;and have little semantic meaning--much of which is open to interpretation
;;it may not suffice to call them predicates, as they are very discourse like too
;;the subjects are not necessarily persons either--they can be pretty much anything
(define-in-predicate "in place")

(define-in-predicate "in lieu")

;;this one is less obvious, and probably requires more attention to detail
;;the problem is "instead" can be used without an overt object
;;e.g. "Instead, the government decided to pull the troops."
;;where the 'object' of "instead" would be someother sentence in the previous discourse
;;this feature is absent from all the above, *"In place of, the government..."
;;(define-in-predicate "instead")

;;cfr to absorb the copula
;;it does carry tense/aspectual information
;;absence of the copula will indicate an adjunct like left or right dislocation
;;e.g. "In command of the army, General Patton..."
;;versus "General Patton is in command of the army."
