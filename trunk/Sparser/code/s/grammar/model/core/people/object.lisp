;;;  version:  0.2 June 2013

;; initiated 6/8/93 v2.3
;; 0.1 (1/7/94) redesigned not to pre-index
;; 0.2 (9/26) promulgating change to how instances are stored. 10/6 added properties
;;  (3/16/05) Adding realization rules.
;;  (2/13/13) Made person specialize named-object (see core/names/object)
;;  (3/6/13) Added another pattern for age. Defined "person" here 3/21.
;;  (3/25/13) Pulled that definition because it required an instance of
;;   "a person" to have a name to be properly indexed. Introduced a new
;;   cagegory -- person-type -- to carry those references. 
;;  (6/6/13) Added position. Added cross-indexing for subseq. ref. Removed
;;   stub special-printer. If we need one it goes in people/printers.lisp

;;;-----------------
;;; types of people
;;;-----------------

#| The person type is for categories like "girl" or "uncle"
 and in particular for "person". They are descriptions of
 particular people or may be for general statements about
 a class of people ('girls are young and female'), though
 that distinction is hard to make with just local evidence.
   When it is a referent to a particular person we will
 usually recognize their name, and at that point we can
 instantiate the person category which is indexed on
 the name, and need to carry over the attributes that
 have acrused to the type, qua hook, and put them on 
 the person instance.
   The define person types are in the people/kinds file.
