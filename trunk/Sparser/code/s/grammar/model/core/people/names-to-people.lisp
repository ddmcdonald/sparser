;; copied over material from [random and hacks] 4/12/95
;; 0.1 (4/25) redid Interpret-name-as-person as a dispatch on itype to handle
;;  collections.  Tweeked .. 5/3
;;  (12/18) started moving the individual cs rules here to centralize them
;; 0.2 (3/16/05) Elaborated Interpret-name-as-person/aux along the same lines
;;  as done with companies.  2/18/13 folded in named-object case.
;;  3/5/13 Moved in the country+person method, Exposed 4/3/13
;; 0.3 (5/26/13) Reworking the interpret-as-name code to fit current scheme,
;;  and pulled in csr's for name and position. Extended 6/6/13.
;;  debugged 7/15/13
