;;;  version:  1.5 September 2013

;; initiated 6/8/93 v2.3, added indexes 6/15.
;; 1.1 (1/7/94) Beginning to simplify the indexing.  Tweeked that 10/3.
;;     (2/24/95) moved in the name maker from [names:fsa:examine].
;;     (3/4) a little work on versions
;;     (5/12) extended find/person-name a little but it isn't done yet
;; 1.2 (7/7) redid Make-person-name-from-items a bit to do versions right
;; 1.3 (10/30) put in a treatment for collections and tweeked versions
;; 1.4 (12/5) fixed glitches in the treatment of versions.
;;     (11/25/12) Blocked stub breaks for the interior of long names
;;      or the presence of 'version' in make-person-name-from-items.
;;     (3/6/13) Got an initial in first-name position. 3/7 revived version.
;;     (6/14/13) Refactored to let the real person-name builder have the
;;      cleaner name.
;; 1.5 (8/16/13) Made the name category permanent. (9/9/13) Added 'last-name'
;;      to the keys of person-name/first-last.
