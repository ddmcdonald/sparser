#| A collection is an unordered bag of items.  We can have partial information
   about a collection and then extend it, though nothing is in place for that
   as yet. |#

#| A sequence is a collection where the order matters.  You can't have partial
   information about a sequence, and I'm not even sure that you can extend them
   without creating a new object.  |#

#|  Removed until we bring this sort of thing back.
