;; initiated 4/9/91 v1.8.2
;; 0.1 (12/15/92 v2.3) setting up for new semantics
;; 0.2 (5/27/94) fleshed it out with def-forms, rdata, and autodef
;;     (9/12/95) tweeked the autodef.  11/15 fixed a typo in them
;; 0.3 (6/6/13) Rebuilt the def form in the modern class-centric idiom. 
;;     (7/1/13) Changed the leading bracket on determiner case to be
;;      ].quantifier, otherwise it messed up on "the last ..."

#| For the purpose of introducing brackets we need to subcategorize
   these into two sorts, roughly determiners and prepositions.
   To do that with autodef we need two categories and two def-forms,
   the categories are unlikely to do any other work in the system
   so /// if there is eventually some way to define a 'pro forma'
   category as such that would be a good thing. |#
