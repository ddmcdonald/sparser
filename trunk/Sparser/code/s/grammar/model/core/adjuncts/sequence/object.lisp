;; initiated 4/9/91 v1.8.2
;; 0.1 (12/15/92 v2.3) setting up for new semantics
;; 0.2 (5/27/94) fleshed it out with def-forms, rdata, and autodef
;;     (9/12/95) tweeked the autodef.  11/15 fixed a typo in them
;; 0.3 (6/6/13) Rebuilt the def form in the modern class-centric idiom. 
;;     (7/1/13) Changed the leading bracket on determiner case to be
;;      ].quantifier, otherwise it messed up on "the last ..."
;;     (7/10/13) modified sequencer and define-sequencer/preposition to 
;;     incorporate interval relations.
;; 0.4 (5/28/14) Rebuilding it in terms of categories rather than 
;;      individuals. (5/30/14) Elaborated the call to define-function-term
;;      and put in the needed form rules
