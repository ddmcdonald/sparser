;; initited 6/15/93, starting over from scratch. 3/17/05 These are
;; interacting with rules made automatically from the etf schemas,
;; so selectively commenting them out while sorting out the issues.
;; 1/22/11 Addresing the intereaction with the schemas to keep these
;; rules because references have to happen before they're created
;; haphadardly by order of ETF definition. Added case of 'to-title'
;; 0.1 (2/21/11) Reworked as marker categories. 
;;     (7/17/13) added age rule
