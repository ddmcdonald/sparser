;;;   Module:  "model;core:titles:"
;;;  version:  2.1 August 2013

;; (4/19/92 v2.2) added title+miscl 
;; 1.0 (6/10/93 v2.3) completely revamped everything from scratch
;; 1.1 (1/6/94) moved [operations] late
;; 1.2 (1/18) added the grammar modules. (3/3) added another one for the core
;; 1.3 (3/15) moved the module definitions to where they belonged 
;;     (10/13) added [types of people].  (2/28/95) added [status printer]
;;     (5/17) added [area of responsibility]
;; 1.4 (12/6) moved over to [object1] with compositional titles. Bumped [operations] to 1
;;     (9/21/09) Put [area of responsibility] under *da* gate
;;     (2/21/11) Annotated the state of the dossiers.
;; 2.0 (3/18/13) Revamping them yet again. Commenting most everything out
;;      to bring them back gradually. 7/23/13 bumped [head-of] to 1 and
;;      put it back in. 
;; 2.1 (8/25/13) added [of-titles], which subsumed all the content of
;;      [head-of1] and [rea of responsibility]. 8/26 Moved operations ahead
;;      of [of-titles] to make its fns available - no longer seems to have
;;      the dependencies that shifted it late.
