;;;  version:  2.0 July 2013

;; initiated 6/10/93 v2.3.  Moved out the print macro 1/6/94 to help the
;; compiler.  1/18 added title-heads and title-modifiers
;; 1.0 (3/17) Redesigned the object so that heads and modifiers and such
;;   could be done seriously.
;;   (12/7/95) actually doing it -- making the 3/17 stub work.
;; 1.1 (1/31/99) pulled the old-style indexing statement from title so that
;;    they could be assembled using lattice-points. 
;;    (3/17/05) Added np-common-noun/one-of-several schema to titlex2
;; 1.2 (2/21/11) Added abbreviated-title for things like CEO. 
;; 2.0 (3/18/13) Redid everything.
;;     (7/17/13) added age+title, which is odd

 This handled "former", which predominately appears in this
function. The other reading I can think of it "the former .. the later".
Need to see how it distributes and what its actual frequency is.

Meaning:  If someone is a "former" <position>? then at some time
in the past they actually held the position.  We can ask 
"when were they the <p>".
