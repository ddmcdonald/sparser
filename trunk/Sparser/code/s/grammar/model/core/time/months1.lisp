;; 1.0 (12/15/92 v2.3) setting up for new semantics
;; 1.1 (9/18/93) actually doing it, fixed fencepost error 9/27
;; 1.2 (1/10/94) redid ordinals     10/20 broke out the cases
;; 1.3 (10/30) realized that treatment of ordinals was screwy & backed out of it
;;     (1/31/99) fixed details in def form.
;;     (2/14) made the abbreviation optional and pulled the indexing instruction
;;      from the category definition. 
;; 1.4 (10/10) Got enough of the schema-connection scheme working to shift all the
;;      rule-creation off to a head-word. Now Define-month is just orchestrating the
;;      set of arguments. // Needs extension for abbreviations an eventually something
;;      for the position in the year.
;; 1.5 (3/15/05) Replaced position-in-a-sequence v/r of position-in-year with ordinal
;;     (3/29/06) Missing close.
;; 1.6 (8/20/08) shifting from proper to common noun because proper noun introduces
;;      a leading ].proper-noun, which seems like overkill. Also rewriting the
;;      category to go to self instead of time
