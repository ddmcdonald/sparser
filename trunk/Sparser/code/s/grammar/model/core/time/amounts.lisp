#| Is this really an NP?  Given "the six months ended Oct. 31, 1995"
 you have to worry about what the justification of that determiner is.
 If it is dependent on the participle (which defines a set that makes
 the amount specific), then how would we represent the intermediate
 state of that parse while waiting for the qualifier to show up? |#
