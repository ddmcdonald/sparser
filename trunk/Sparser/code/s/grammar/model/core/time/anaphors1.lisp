;;;  version:  1.2 March 2011

;; 1.1 (10/19/94) completely reconceptualized.  10/30 fixed bad v/r
;;     (8/28/95) added simple phrases with sequencers
;;     (3/9/05) added form rules.
;; 1.2 (9/24/09) Commented out the define-realization for calculated-time
;;      at the end of the file because the tighter treatment of variables
;;      makes it untenable since there's no variable named 'time' to associate
;;      with 'modifier' (or perhaps the ETF needs to be changed ??)
;; 1.3 (3/15/11) Changed the rule categories of the 'calculated' categories
;;      to be just 'time' by changing their :instantiates values
