;;;  version:  1.5 May 2014

;; 1.0 (9/18/93 v2.3) completely revamped for new semantics
;; 1.1 (1/10/94) redid ordinals.  Broke out the cases 10/20
;; 1.2 (10/30) realized that treatment of ordinals was screwy & backed out of it
;;     (1/31/99) tweaked the call to define-individual so that the ordinal
;;      was included.
;; 1.3 (3/15/05) Replaced position-in-a-sequence v/r of position-in-week with
;;      ordinal.
;; 1.4 (5/30/13) Re-labeled category weekday as time syntactically.
;;      weekday still labeled as both weekday and time, duplicate has remained elusive.
;; 1.5 (6/13/13) Found the problem. Original code needed to write the rule
;;      "by hand" in the def form. Now that's done by the act of defining the
;;      individual, and that version of doing it pays attention to rule-label.
;;     (5/29/14) Made them sequential and cyclic
