;; 0.1 (7/18 v1.8.6) Flushed the CA routines as redundant w/ the CS rules
;; 0.2 (4/16/92 v2.2) added two more rules to handle "60-year-old"
;; 0.3 (5/16 v2.2) Commented out the "year" rules in favor of time-unit rules
;; 1.0 (12/15/92 v2.3) setting up for new semantics
;; 1.1 (4/27/94) doing that. 
;;     (10/6) really doing it
