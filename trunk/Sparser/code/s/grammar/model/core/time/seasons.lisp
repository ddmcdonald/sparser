;; Initated 6/11/13. Worked over 6/12: Added an index specification
;; to the category, dropped the abbreviation (see dossiers/seasons),
;; shrank the defining function down by using a define-or-find to
;; do the heavy lifting and setting the position in year as a separate
;; operation. Added some citation texts to help figure out where to 
;; place these in the type-lattice

This pattern is the same one that we get for months
and years, and would hold for periods in the day ("morning", 
"evening") for the most part. 

"Spring"
"spring"
"early spring"  -- mid
"late Spring"
"last spring"  -- next


Maybe these are specific to seasons (among stuff in time)

"spring has started"
-- is (almost) over

  ;; into a word and creates the two rules that go with
  ;; being a common noun (i.e. singular and plural forms)
  ;; with the season individual as their referent
