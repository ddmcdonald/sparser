  :documentation "'Region' is taken abstractly here using the notion of demarcation or
 setting boundaries over some domain to pick out a particular part of
 it. You can have a region of the number line, a region of a
 process (e.g. S-phase in cell division), a region of space. The emphasis on
 regions having interiors in which other things can be located.  The world
 itself is not cut up into nice parts. Any partitionings or identification
 of regions are arbitrary cognitive constructs, which makes them abstract:
 not situated in time or space.
    An earlier version of this class had an 'applicable-domain' slot
 in it to identify 'The kind of stuff this regain demarcates: numbers, cytoplasm,
 curricula, geographical space, etc.', however it not been clear how to
 fill this slot with anything without going second order (i.e. using a
 class), and it's worth exploring that that would come to in some use-case."

; membrane of a cell, the border (DMZ) between two countries, the cover

; Region for its existence."

 "A container is a region that has (at least the potential) to contain
 stuff -- to have stuff in it, particularly stuff that can move in or
 out of it. Containers can have other containers among their contents.
 We separate out 'containment' from 'region' because regions don't
 have to have contents, just extent.
    Like the 'applicable-domain' of Region, the original version of
 Container had a 'kind-of-thing-contained', but again, it was only
 going to be informational without 2d order machinery, and we can get
 much of the same effect through range restrictions on the 'contents'
 slot.")
