;; This file holds independent lambda variables and such that
;; don't otherwise have a natural place to put them, or that refer
;; to categories that aren't yet defined at that place. 

;; Started populating 4/10/13.
;; 7/1/13 Added generic method for compose. 3/31/14 added a t,t method.
;; 4/9/14 Added the wrapper call-compose.
