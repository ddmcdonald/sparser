#| Defines the set of 'expressive categories' (see Meteer 1992) that we're
   experimenting with as the top tier of our domain model.  This sort of thing
   is often referred to as an 'upper model'. This is loosely derived from
   the refinements to that model made at Zoesis in 2003.  

   Need some axioms and tighter review before buying in completely.
   Also need a merger with my adoption of Dolce.

;; 0.1 (8/1/11) Moved in the 'top' categories from other parts of the
;;      core so they can be defined before they're referenced. 8/23 added
;;      the first relation. 9/16 added modifier (words;adverbs) tenatively.
;;      9/29 added operator as in the meeaning from the old days.
;;      12/17 added perdurant, not clear how to fit it in correctly.
;; 0.2 (4/5/13) Exposed top and expressible top so there was somewhere
;;      to hand the type variable.
;;     (8/19/13) Trying a stand-alone definition for "relation" to go with
;;      the class. 12/17/13 added scalar-quality and state

; This is the category that dominates almost everything in the model.
; These are the things that the world is comprised of - things, actions, 
; properties -- unicorns, raising money, being -really- good.  
;
; You have to think very carefully if you want to introduce something
; into the ontology that isn't a subcategory (doesn't inherit from)
; expressive type. 
; 
; If we ignoring the capabilities provided by language and interpersonal
; talk, everything that you model will get a single category (or a base
; category and some mixins). But people have more options and can express
; the same state of affairs from different perspectives -- the canonical
; example is 'making a decision' and 'deciding', where you shift between
; a thing and an action. These differences correspond here to differences
; in the choice of expressive type and could be made for tactical reasons
; within the text planner.

;;; operator et al.
;;;-----------------

; The intuitions for the notion of 'operator' come ultimately from
; logic. This is classification for properties (in this model these
; are 'qualities' to stay with the clearest current literature) like
; 'tall' or 'unusual' and for logical operators like 'not'.  
;
; Metaphysically speaking we group these together becase they are
; concepts that only pick out a thing in the world when they are
; part of a predication.  Some, like colors, are pretty vivid concepts,
; but except neurologically the world only has colored things,
; not colors qua colors. 
;
; Operationally we have the category 'operator' as the root category
; of every quality, manner, conventional operator, and so that the parser
; can have a uniform way of handling the grammatical juxtaposition
; of operators with the terms as looking up in the model for a predication 
; that that particular category of operator with that particular category
; of term ("smart demon", "not unusual", "expected outcome").
; Virtually all of the adjunction-based resources refer to something 
; that derives from operator, which goes along with the fact that adjuncts 
; are always grammatically optional.

; the syntactic basis for the combination is definitive but there isn't
; something already available for it in the model.

;;--- categories that are classifications of effects rather than stuff

; Grunts, expression of pain, exclamations, and the like are the natural
; province of this category.  It is sometimes used when the motivation
; seems to be immediate and direct rather than involving any sort of
; considered choice. The best theory on this sort of 'direct pass through'
; notion is from Amanda Stent.
;
(define-category direct-expression-of-intent
  super-category expressible-type) ;; // might want to be 'top'



; The speaker's intent gets converted to the instruction to carry out
; a particular 'dialog-move' when it crosses the line and initiates the
; generation process. Dialog moves are basic things like questioning or 
; asserting a proposition, as well as smaller ones like evoking a person's
; name or adding a tag that disambiguates an anaphor.  
;
; A dialog move necessarily involves someone (something?) who's speaking,
; who they're speaking to, and the content of what they say -- which is
; reflected in the variables associated with this category (though they're
; not restricted to just this category  -- there's always a speaker and
; an interlocutor (or several interlocutors/hearers/the-audience) and
; there's (nearly) always content. Remember that variables have a life
; of their own independent of categories. Categories can insist on having
; certain variables (their slots), and can impose value restrictions on
; them that (in principle, but the implementation is weak) can vary from
; category to category.
;   Subcategories of dialog move will often have a richer descrimination
; of their content, e.g. motive+action, deny+reassert, which is reflected
; in their choice of variables.
;
; An important subclass of dialog moves (which so far its hasn't seemed
; useful to break out) are 'speech acts' which are being read here very 
; narrowly as the classic set of actions achieved through the direct use 
; of language: promising, explicit naming/proclaiming (e.g. the act that
; makes you married), denying, etc. 

(define-category dialog-move
  super-category top
  slots ((speaker . expressible-type)  ;; allows rocks and events to talk
         (interlocutor . expressible-type) ;; who it's directed to
         (content . expressible-type)
         (center . individual) ;; might have to elevate the v/r
         ))

; The canonical slot, 'content', is for what it is that's said to the interlocutor.
; The initial motivation comes from Forbid, where there are several choices that
; make the speaker and hearer explicit in addition to the obvious command where
; they're implicit.  The content field is the basis of the weight of the
; message nodes that wrap dialog moves. The additional weight from explicit
; mention of the interlocutors is unlikely to matter.
  



; Rhetorical is a category only because we use categories to organize
; choice sets. (Essentially the same is true for dialog-move though they 
; often are realized by verbs, e.g. "promise", and something rhetorical would
; never that lexically explicit.)  
;
; It is the classification for the intuitive rhetorical moves like hedging
; or emphasizing, and also for stylistic effects (e.g. sentence length),
; and also for labeling individuals like maybe-add-both' that provide
; carriers for alternative choices that add very little to the semantic
; content being realized, and that are factored out so that they can save
; us space by appearing as follow-ons to choices rather than multiplying
; the choices.
;
(define-category rhetorical
  super-category top)



; Frame and  state-of-affairs are envelop categories whose realizations
; would be choices over regular categories. They are used to model
; notions of alternative perspective or of complex situations where
; you would deliberate over what element of the situation to focus on.

(define-category anchored-in-time
  super-category expressible-type
  slots ((modality . modality)
         (time . time)
         (aspect . aspect)))

; This is a super-category over states and events and such that provides
; a common place to position variables that apply to all of them. This way
; of thinking about it is due to Talmy.



;;--- situations

(define-category situation
  super-category anchored-in-time)

; The terms 'situation' and 'state of affairs' pretty much cover the same
; territory, so the difference here is technical.  A state-of-affairs object
; is a way to model a complex situation as a set of concrete events, states,
; and participants by bundling them into a single envelop that a very
; early decision process picks through.  Situations are used almost as
; anaphors to refer to the state of affairs atomically. They're the
; referents of things like the 'it' in "It's raining again" or for
; phrases like "what's the big deal?"



;;--- events 

(define-category eventuality
  super-category anchored-in-time)

; 'Eventuality is a term introduced by Emmond Bach to abstract
; events away from (what amounts to) their tense. We have the same
; eventuality ("Marie <get> a bicycle") whether it's a goal for the
; future, what's happening right now in the store, or happened years
; ago. 


(define-category action-by-an-agent
  super-category eventuality

(define-category action-upon-a-patient

  slots ((patient . individual)))

(define-category agentive-action-with-tacit-result   ;; hurt, injure, elect
  slots ((result-state . result-of-past-event))
  super-category action-upon-a-patient)

; This set of specific kinds of eventualities is just the tip of the
; iceburg for reifying the relationships between the participants in
; an eventuality.  I can see do it thoroughly as a way to control
; what kinds of adjunctions you can make to specific base categories 
; of objects, which would let the generator make accurate (felicitous)
; compositions on its own without getting the message-builder involved
; beyond just specifying the intended rhetorical effect / dialog move.




;;--- actions 

(define-category action
  super-category expressible-type)

; If you abstract the agent/subject away from an eventuality you get an
; action: "swimming off Dorchester beach in January", "kissing", "kissing
; your wife".  These pick out generic things in the world rather than
; actual ones -- for that we have eventualiies and states. If it were useful
; to model something along the same lines as the grammatical decomposition
; of a clause (sentence) into subject and predicate, you'd have an individual
; in the subject and an action in the predicate.



;;--- states, propositions, facts, etc.

(define-category state
  super-category anchored-in-time
  slots ((theme . individual)))


(define-category result-of-past-event
  super-category state
  slots ((initiating-event . eventuality)))
 #| This leads to including features for have+en - the 'present perfect' 
    See L&S #115 'past event with result in the present time' the result
    is assumed to be ongoing now. |# 


(define-category state-of-an-individual  ;; vs. a state of affairs or a situation
  super-category state
  slots ((individual-whose-state-it-is . individual)))
;
; This is a subclassification of state in the same style as the one for
; eventuality in that it reifies the relationship between the particpants,
; and we'd elaborate it further for the same reasons -- providing some structure
; to adjunct/operator resources by specifying what kind of object they
; can compose with.


(define-category proposition
  super-category anchored-in-time)
;
; Proposition is distinguished from state in that we take states to 
; be real -- true descriptions of the current situation, whereas
; propositions have truth values and may or may not actually describe
; the world.  /// They're also believed or not, which is a variation
; on the notion of truth value. This calls for standard variables.


(define-category assessment
  super-category proposition)
;
; An assessment is a judgment about something (could have used that word
; as well, though it's connations seem narrower). /// It could have some
; standard variables, but I'm not sure what


(define-category proposal
  super-category anchored-in-time)
;
; A proposal is a future eventuality or state that some agent believes
; should come to pass. These are the P's in "I propose that P", that is
; to say that the act of proposing is formalized as a dialog-move (i.e. a
; category that inherits from dialog-move), and what you are proposing is
; an instance of this category.




;;--- qualities

; The term 'quality' is the choice of the current ontology literature (though
; it goes back to Aristotle) for what might otherwise be called   a 'property'
; or an 'attibute'. Those words come from the intimate association of these
; things with predications, but "quality" conceptualizes them in pure form
; independent of predications, which is what we want. These are the canonical
; example of an operator.

;;-- shadings on quality that may or may not actually be useful

; This is a specialization of quality that focuses on the quality as 
; it is manifest in a particular actor -- so when instantiated
; you'd get individuals that would allow you model, e.g., the difference in
; the nature/strength/appreciation of the quality as it is held by one
; actor vs. it's nature/etc. as it is manifest in another actor.
; It was used in the BBG model for 'leadership'.
;
(define-category quality-of
  super-category actor
  slots ((actor . individual)))


(define-category state-predicate
  super-category quality)
;
; Our 'states' are relations over individuals and anchored in time.
; If we want to quantify over the 'state' per se, independent of these
; normal concomitants, then we need a different notion -- this one.
; In PC this would be the predicate and the customary states would be
; the wffs.  The "calm" in "You need to stay calm" is a state-predicate.
;/// this terms does not trip off the tongue. Would be nice to find
;    a better one. This terminology is analogous to the predicate in
;    breaking an event down into a subject and predicate, where we have
;    the ready made word 'action' for what the agent in the subject
;    position did. 




;;--- things

(define-category anchored-in-space

; This is super category of individuals and categories qua kinds. 


;;--- generic things: categories, natural kinds, types

; "Kind" is one of the standard terms for references to categories of
; stuff when they are used to be general/generic statements:
; "lions eat people", "the lion is a proud animal", "People who swim in icy cold 
; water are crazy."
;
; Virtually any category can be construed as a kind ('intruder', 'prince', 
; 'professor', 'character architect', ...), so that is what we are going
; to do -- if we want to make a generic statement about something we will use
; its category as the representation that we pass to the generator. 
; Specifically we will use the category from the perspective of ('qua') 
; a kind, where the subcategories pick out the different ways kinds can
; be expressed: plurals and definites respectively.

; Time is to spell out the location of the eventuality/state in time in so far
;   as that's reflected in the surface language. Candidate cases besides past

;   little while'. Note that English doesn't have a future tense -- it has
