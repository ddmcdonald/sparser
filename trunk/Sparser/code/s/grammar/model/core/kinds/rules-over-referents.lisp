;;--- for event

#| The category for event has these variables:
  time, location, purpose, modifier, participant
|#

;;//// Add schema -- from vp adjuncts perhaps
(def-cfr event (event time)
  :form s

;;--- title grammar

(def-form-rule (possessive title)
  :form np
  :head :right-edge
  ;;//// Dropping the argument ("Iraq's .. minister")
  ;; on the floor for the moment. See syntax/possessive
  ;; for a method to use in this rule. 
  ;;/// N.b. doesn't work in *iraqi-girl* because of timing
  ;; where the title has been swallowed before the country
  ;; could see it.  A heuristic might be entitled to lift
  ;; up the left edge on the grounds that it must compose
  ;; so it's only a question of which edge it composes
  ;; with -- a peek would get this rule and look for a
  ;; title.
