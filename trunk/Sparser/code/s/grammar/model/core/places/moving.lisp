;;;  version:  November 2011

;; Intended for modeling movement in direction or w.r.t. some
;; spatial feature.

;; initated 8/4/11. 9/5/11 added path-type adjunct. 9/12 Added some more.
;; 9/26 "immediately". More bits through 10/4/11. 11/3 added DA rule to
;; convert a name.

;; turn <direction> onto<path>
;; cross <landmark ??>
;; follow <path> to<configuration> past<landmark> (<distance>)

;; means we won't see any of them until we get to the forest level,
;; but if they don't individually combine we'll get there one adjunct
;; at a time in order.
