;; initiated 4/4/94 v2.3.  Added string/region 10/5.  Added missing typecase
;; to String-for 6/22.  (9/12) tweeked the autodef
;; (7/18/11) Starting makeover/rationalization from lots of ex.
;; (2/4/12) Changed tree family on region to defnp from definite because
;;  that better fits what's in the data: "the country" blew up with
;;  np-common-noun/definite because that makes a new individual and regions
;;  are hashed on their names -- with the gensym'd individual didn't have.
;; (2/28/13) Putting in the ETF and function to supply a region's name
;;  when we get it in an 'of' construction. 3/8/13 Why does a region-type
;;  like 'city' inherit from 'location'? Copied the relationship-to-country
;;  method to pick that up. ///Need to review the category choices and
;;  inheritance structure in here. 5/24/13 Removed the np-common-noun/defnp
;;  case from region because it was creating a form rule that was too specific.
;; (7/30/13) Rewrote relationship-to-country to use revise-parent-edge
