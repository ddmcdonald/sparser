;;;  version:  0.3 November 2011

;; initiated in 10/12/92 v2.3. Added 'kind of location' 1/17/94.  Added location-
;; phrase 11/16/95. Added relative-location 11/99. 11/25 Moved in spatial-
;; orientation (from [words;]). 12/12 fixed choice of category name.
;; 0.1 (7/13/08) Included a subcategory within define-kind-of-location so we no
;;   longer have to write kind-specific categories and rules. 
;; 0.2 (4/19/09) Commented out the relative-location rule because it is
;;   masking verb-centric categories. 4/27 Added here, there as deictic-locations
;;   6/15 Added over here, over there as deictic-locations
;;   7/23 Added a treatment for "from," not sure if I'm happy with it. Throwing
;;   away the "form" analysis as way too narrow and presumptuous. 
;; 0.3. 7/21/11 Moved spatial-orientation and relative-location out to [relational]
;;   and location-description to [descriptive]. 8/14 Added name variable.
;;   and an index off of it. 9/12/11 added a bunch of named pp's. 11/1 added
;;   at-location.
