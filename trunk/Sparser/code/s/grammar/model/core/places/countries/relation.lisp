;; initiated 8/6/07. Moved out the generic routine 9/4. Changed one of
;; the form rules from np-head to common-noun since that's what we
;; actually get. 
;; 0.1 (3/4/13) Substantially reworking it. Using an ETF. Fixed the
;;  method 3/8.  Blocking it 3/9  because the set of rules that
;;  actually get created is bogus. Put it back 4/3 when Chomnsky-adjunction
;;  put into the rule creator.

#|  The design question is whether to use category or simply to
define a lambda variable that names the relation and have a rule
that links the country and the item. (See models/sl/military/ranks.lisp)
  Both can be annotated for provinance (probably use a plist or
an external table in either case).
  Only the category can be specialized though (as things stand),
so if we want to refine the choice of relationship according to the
type of the item (person, vs city, vs government official) then we
should use a category and use methods for the composition
