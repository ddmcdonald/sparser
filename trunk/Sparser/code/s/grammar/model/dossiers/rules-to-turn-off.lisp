;;;   Module:  "model;dossiers:"
;;;  version:  November 2012

;; initiated 11/24/12 to solve problem of rules interferring with what's
;; needed in Grok. The full set of rules and actions are designed for
;; deep parsing and information extraction. They can make assumptions
;; that are not suitable for other analysis modes such as Fire or Grok
;; and are not amenable to handle by omitting grammar modules or specific
;; switch settings.
