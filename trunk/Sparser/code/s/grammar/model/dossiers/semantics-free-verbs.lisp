;; initiated 7/27/94 v2.3 for autodef. 
;; Taken over 3/27/09 to hold the abbreviated self-categorizing definitions
;; of lots & lots of verbs. 3/26/10 Started fleshing it out using /rules/treefamilies/
;; shortcuts forms. 7/11/11 That only got to one verb which is shortly going to be
;; modeled explicitly, so evicertated it.
