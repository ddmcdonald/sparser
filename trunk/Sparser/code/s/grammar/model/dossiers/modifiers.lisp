;; Created 1/4/13 to group together comparatives, approximators, etc in
;; one place so they're easier to keep track of. (1/9/13) Moved in all
;; the adverbs from words/adverbs1, including the ones with only function 
;; word definitions because their category hasn't been defined yet. 
;; (1/18/13) put in define-position-in-process. 5/22 added "no longer"
;; (5/30/13) added in earlier, sooner as adverbs and function words
;; 5/6/14 Moved in the quantities from its own file

;; (A)  "I have just seven days left"
;; (B)  "I just came back from there"
