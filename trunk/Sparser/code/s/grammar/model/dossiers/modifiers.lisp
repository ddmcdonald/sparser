;; Created 1/4/13 to group together comparatives, approximators, etc in
;; one place so they're easier to keep track of. (1/9/13) Moved in all
;; the adverbs from words/adverbs1, including the ones with only function 
;; word definitions because their category hasn't been defined yet. 
;; (1/18/13) put in define-position-in-process. 5/22 added "no longer"

;; initiated 6/6/93 v2.3.  5/27/94 removed "several".

;; (A)  "I have just seven days left"
;; (B)  "I just came back from there"

;;  These bind to their left,
