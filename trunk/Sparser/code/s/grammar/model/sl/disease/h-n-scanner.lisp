#|  From http://www.agriculture.ny.gov/AI/AvianFlu.html
AI virus is an RNA virus (orthomyxovirus) and, as is typical of influenza viruses, 
often mutates producing different strains. As the virus infects and replicates 
in successive hosts it recombines genes with any other available influenza virus 
in unpredictable ways. The different strains are labeled according to the types of 
2 proteins (Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase) on the surface of the virus that are 
instrumental in the virusâ€™ ability to penetrate a cell and replicate itself. 
There are 16 different H types and 9 different N types so a multitude of 
combinations are possible e.g. H1N1, H7N2, H6N9 and etc.  |#

; This is an explicit no-space FSA, as opposed to a uniform no-space 
; sequence where we're just collecting all the words into edge.
; This is checked from just after the polyword check, by a call from
; check-for/initiate-scan-patterns when it was noticed that there
; was no space between the previous word and the one that was just
; scanned. The uniform scan is tried after this one.
