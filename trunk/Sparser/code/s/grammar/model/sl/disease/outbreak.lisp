;;category to represent outbreaks of diseases
;;e.g. "this is only the second outbreak of H5N1 in France"
;;split this category from spread, since the two are different semantically
;;outbreak generally follows the form of "outbreak (of pathogen)"
;;disease spreading events deviate from such a simple pattern
;;since they also include carriers/vectors, as well as targets (more verb like)
;;this category setup follows a pattern set for target in model;core:finance
