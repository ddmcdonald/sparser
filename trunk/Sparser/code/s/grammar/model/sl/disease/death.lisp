 It's a classic 'process=>resulting-state' system. If one is dying (vb), the
 result is death (n), whereupon one is dead (adj). The agent that brought 
 about one's death is deadly (adv). The process is intransitive; the agentive
 form uses a different (set of) verb(s), e.g. kill. 
    They all revolve around the same core concept, so they could be based
 on the same category
