;;removed citations having to do with outbreaks specifically
;;moved these to sl;disease:outbreak

;;in a very general sense we can think of disease spreading events as being trivalent
;;i.e. spread involves a transmission from a source to a target location via some carrier
;;e.g. "bird flu is believed to spread along bird migration routes"
;;here the source is not specified, target = migration routes, vector = birds
;;from the articles however spreading events do not always manifest this way syntactically
;;there are other headwords, like "transmit," "find", which each have different syntax

;;a skeletal category definition, not yet implemented
#|(define-category spread
  :specializes event
  :instantiates self
  :binds ((source location)
          (target location)
          (vector carrier))
