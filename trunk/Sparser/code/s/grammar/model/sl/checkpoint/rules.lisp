So here's what I'm getting hung up on...

(p "did you go there") is producing:

e0    do                      1 "did" 2
e6    event                   2 "you go there" 5

But I want it to give me something like:

e6    be/do-pro               1 "did you" 3
e7    event                   3 "go there" 5

Which in turn should combine via the new inquiry
cfr to produce:

e8    inquiry                 1 "did you go there" 5

But event is so greedy that it over powers the
be/do-pro rule and immediately sucks up the "you,"
and the be/do-pro is never created so it can't be
combined to form the inquiry.
