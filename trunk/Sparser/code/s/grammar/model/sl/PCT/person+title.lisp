;; initiated 6/11/93 v2.3, populated with appositive rule 6/15
;; 0.1 (1/28/94) changing the relation to be 'has-title', and adding it.
;;     (2/29/08) commented out the define-realization rather than debug it now.
;; 0.2 (7/19/13) Moved in the title/person rules that were accumulating 
;;      in names to people
