;; Initiated 3/2/14. 5/22/14 Added synonyms field to def-bio.
;; 6/9/14 Pulled types out from regular kinds. 7/24/14 reorganized.
;; 9/8/14 lifted taxonomy out to its own file, added keyword to
;; inhibit plurals, defaults to allow plurals. Working on nits
;; to make the parser happy through 1/6/15
;; 3/21/2015 -- revised make-typed-bio-entity              
;; SBCL caught fact that some words are actually polywords here...
;; 4/19/15 Added stub for handling acronyms.
;; 5/16/2015 attempt (not quite working) to define get-mitre-id which tries to get the MITRE-LINK value for a protein (for example)
