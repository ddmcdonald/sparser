;;;  Module: "grammar/model/sl/biology/
;;; version: April 2015

;; Lifted from mechanics 9/8/14. Tweaks through 10/29/14.
;; 11/9/14 Bunch of reworking on bio taxonomy, still a work in progress, 
;;bio-conditions, bio-locations, species
;; added step for biology (was defined in comlex), 
;; bio-variant for "form of <protein>", protein-segment for "G-dommain" and G1-box
;; RJB 12/14/2014 add cell-line (need to deal with this better)
;; 12/30/14 Reorganized to readability. Moved pathway to phenomena.lisp
;; 1/1/2015 fix (?) taxonomy above protein-family, to make it a sub-category of molecule
;; 1/1/2015 give biological a variable bio-context, and make bio-location be a bio-context
;; added variable mutation to protein to allow new rule for protein --> (protein point-mutation) for "ubiquitin C77G"
;; /22/2015 added variables for adverb and manner to category::predicate, bi0-process
;; added process-rate and redefined the noun meaning of rate -- over-ride old meaning
;; 2/5/15 Removed mutant from the variables on protein.
;; 4/15/15 Moved out a flock of verbs to verb1. There were duplications.
;; 4/16/2015 bunch of changes to make protein-family a protein in most senses -- it specializes protein, but has some
;;  special variables like :members. Also give protein and human-protein-family a sbcat frame for "in"
;; 4/23/15 Lifted out the dimer classes to phenomena to have all the parts
;;  in the same place. 
;; 4/24/2015 added mixins for bio-thtcomp and bio-whethercomp -- verbs that take thatcomps and whethercomps
;; 4/27/2015 remoe definition of amino-acid and move to that file, and add defnitions for
;;  nominal for "loading"
;; 4/30/2015 bunch of changes to partially merge biopax3/reactome categories with taxonomy
;; introduce new subcategories of location â€” molecular-location (for site and residue), cellular-location (organelles within a cell), non-cellular-location (for things like cell-line, species, organism)
;; 5/15/2015 substantial revision in taxonomy to drastically reduce the overloading of bio-process,
;;  provide bio-rhetorical as a marker for verbs that talk about belief and truth, bio-event for actions that are not bio-processes in the OBO sense, bio-relation for things like
;;  contain, sonstitute, etc.
;;  concomitant revision for things like thatcomp and whethercomp
;; 5/16/2015 add in all the cellular locations shown in the MITRE ras1 corpus, including their GO identifiers
;; 5/30/2015 Rename poorly named "predicate" to "bio-predication" and update dependencies
;; 6/8.2015 added cyclic and plasmid definitions
