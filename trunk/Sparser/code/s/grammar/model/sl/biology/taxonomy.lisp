;; Lifted from mechanics 9/8/14. Tweaks through 10/29/14.
;; 11/9/14 Bunch of reworking on bio taxonomy, still a work in progress, bio-conditions, bio-locations, species
;; added step for biology (was defined in comlex), bio-variant for "form of <protein>", protein-segment for "G-dommain" and G1-box
;; RJB 12/14/2014 add cell-line (need to deal with this better)

 superc list is (abstract relation relation) 
 Relation is a subclass of abstract, so it's (super sub sub)
