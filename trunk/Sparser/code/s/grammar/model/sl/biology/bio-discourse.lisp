;;; ===PHRASES===

;;; from Hallmarks of Cancer

;;; "recent results"
;;; Recent results have highlighted the importance of negative-feedback loops that 
;;; normally operate to dampen various types of signaling and thereby ensure homeostatic 
;;; regulation of the flux of signals coursing through the intracellular circuitry.


;;; "early studies"
;;; Early studies of oncogene action encouraged the notion that ever-increasing 
;;; expression of such genes and the signals manifested in their protein products 
;;; would result in correspondingly increased cancer cell proliferation and thus tumor growth.

;;; ----------------------------------

;;; from Dragging Ras Back in the Ring

;;; "early efforts"
;;; Early efforts to block Ras cancers by preventing Ras farnesylation, once thought to be an
;;; essential posttranslational modification for Ras activity, were thwarted by the unexpected
;;; presence of a backup system (geranylgeranyltransferase) that restored activity of K-Ras and
;;; N-Ras after farnesyltransferase treatment. 


;;; "new efforts"
;;; A convergence of urgent unmet clinical needs and advances in drug discovery has energized 
;;; new efforts to target Ras cancers within academic centers and in the biopharmaceutical industry.

;;; "not yet" -- Adverby, but makes reference to earlier (failed) trials
;;; Inhibitors of PI3K pathway have not yet fared much better in the clinic, also because of feedback
;;; mechanisms that activate upstream signaling, as well as poor therapeutic index. 

;;; "recent advances" 
;;; "ahead"
;;; Here, we will discuss some of these knowledge gaps, as well as recent advances and the 
;;; challenges that lie ahead.
