#| To make sense of a mutation identifier we need to be able to
decipher the three-letter and one-letter codes. The three letter
codes can probably be free-standing words, but the one letter
ones are gratuitously ambiguous with capitalized initials.

Sometimes it is not possible two differentiate two closely related amino acids, 
therefore we have the special cases:
  asparagine/aspartic acid - asx - B
  glutamine/glutamic acid - glx - Z
