;; Initiated 12/3/14 by lifting verbs from verbs.lisp
;; define verbs (svo/passive/nominal encode, mutate and make some verbs more specific (enhancement enhances a bio-process)
;; NOTE TO DAVID --  of-nominal should be implied for the present participle of every verb
;; it may also be the case that :of-nominal should be the default for every verb with a specified noun form
;; and by-subject should be implied for the past participle of every svo=passive

;; DAVID -- note that binding and release can be described as happening onto or from either sites, domains or molecules as a whole -- this smacks of metonymy

;; almost all of these verbs optionally take adjunctive pp modifiers of the category "bio-context" in the form "in-bio-location" and "in-bio-condition"
