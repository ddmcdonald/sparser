;; The existing svo shortcut is so simplistic that using it is just
;; a hack to have the work marked up as being a verb

;;--- "increase"
;; Observed as a verb: 
;;  "Other less frequently observed mutations, such as those found in the
;;  G4 and G5 boxes, increase the rate of nucleotide exchange, thereby
;;  mimicking the GEFs and increasing the GTP-bound state."
;; But the noun form is probably in there too.
;; Note that there's a dossier of change-in-amount-verbs though it's
;; not being loaded which goes with, e.g., define-change-in-amount-verb/up
;; which presumes a 'standalone-direction' category which exists
;; in places/directions but doesn't work the way it used to or was
;; abandoned between directions and directions1
