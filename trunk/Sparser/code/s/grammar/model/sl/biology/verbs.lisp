;; Observed as a verb: 
;;  "Other less frequently observed mutations, such as those found in the
;;  G4 and G5 boxes, increase the rate of nucleotide exchange, thereby

;; But the noun form is probably in there too.
;; Note that there's a dossier of change-in-amount-verbs though it's
;; not being loaded which goes with, e.g., define-change-in-amount-verb/up

;; in places/directions but doesn't work the way it used to or was
;; abandoned between directions and directions1
