;; Initiated 7/23/14 by lifting proteins from NFkappaB experiment.
;; Moved proteins out to their own file 9/8/14
;;; temporary home for rules
;;; gene  --> mutate gene
;;; enzyme --> bio-process enzyme
;;; move out oncoogene to taxonomy, and mutate to be a verb (so mutated is a past participle)
;; 11/9/14 hack for ', in part,' and terms for g1,...,g5, 'as a consequence' and .exchange' as a bio-process
;; added critical, common, "tumor formation", first stab at "form", revised "condition", revised "G-domain"
;; 12/8/14 Starting cell lines and drugs
;; RJB 12/13/2014 ugly handling of variety, form and analog <<DAVID-- we have to talk about this>>
;; also ugly handling of "et al." to start making it a signal for references, 
;; and get rid of the interpretation of "al." as a bio-entity (couldn't even find where that cam from)
;; RJB 12/14/2014 Added a bunchof stand-in definitions for words that were primed by COMLEX, added cell-line definitions (some) -- need help from <<DAVID>>
;; add MEK/ERK and ERK/MEK as pathway designators, try to define S338 as a residue
;; add form rule for relative-clause --> (that vp)
;; diverse vocabulary hacking
;; 02/18/15 alphabetized terms
;; 4/24/2015 added subject variable for many adjectives that can be copular adjectives
;; 4/27/2015 improve handling of "serum" and "fetal calf serum" and "open reading frame" using def-synonym
;; 5/15/2015 substantial revision in taxonomy to drastically reduce the overloading of bio-process,
;;  provide bio-rhetorical as a marker for verbs that talk about belief and truth, bio-event for actions that are not bio-processes in the OBO sense, bio-relation for things like
;;  contain, sonstitute, etc.
;;  concomitant revision for things like thatcomp and whethercomp
