;;; version: December 2014

;; Initiated 7/23/14 by lifting proteins from NFkappaB experiment.
;; Moved proteins out to their own file 9/8/14
;;; temporary home for rules
;;; gene  --> mutate gene
;;; enzyme --> bio-process enzyme
;;; move out oncoogene to taxonomy, and mutate to be a verb (so mutated is a past participle)
;; 11/9/14 hack for ', in part,' and terms for g1,...,g5, 'as a consequence' and .exchange' as a bio-process
;; added critical, common, "tumor formation", first stab at "form", revised "condition", revised "G-domain"
;; 12/8/14 Starting cell lines and drugs
;; RJB 12/13/2014 ugly handling of variety, form and analog <<DAVID-- we have to talk about this>>
;; also ugly handling of "et al." to start making it a signal for references, 
;; and get rid of the interpretation of "al." as a bio-entity (couldn't even find where that cam from)
;; RJB 12/14/2014 Added a bunchof stand-in definitions for words that were primed by COMLEX, added cell-line definitions (some) -- need help from <<DAVID>>
;; add MEK/ERK and ERK/MEK as pathway designators, try to define S338 as a residue
;; add form rule for relative-clause --> (that vp)
