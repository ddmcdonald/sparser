#| At the point when this is called, all of the phrases (text strings)
that applied to this sentence will have been seen by complete and 
had their effect on the slots that the expistemic-status class added
to the contents instance that is in the contents slot of this sentence
that's been passed in as an argument  You can get to the paragraph object
that this sentence is part of by calling (parent sentence), and the slots
contributed by epistemic state will be on the object in its contents slot.
   I imagine that this is where you update the paragraph state give
what's happened for this sentence, and that to answer the question
of whether or not to declare this sentence to be relevant is a calculation
over both sentence and paragraph, deferring to the paragraph when there's
no evidence in the sentence.

#| The check-for-<relation> functions consider a two sentences
and determine if a discourse relation can hold between them.
The current possible relations are split into two types, bio
and structural. The former are computed using the sentences'
discourse roles, while the latter only look for specific lexical
triggers. 

bio-discourse-relations:
    - background-knowledge
    - evidence-for
    - same-role 
structural-discourse-relations:
    - contrast
    - result-of

the sentences is not considered. |#
