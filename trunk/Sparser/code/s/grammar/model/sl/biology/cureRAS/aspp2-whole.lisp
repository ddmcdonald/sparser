  '((p "It has recently been shown that oncogenic RAS can enhance the apoptotic function of p53 via ASPP1 and ASPP2.")
    (p "Mechanistically ASPP1 and ASPP2 bind RAS-GTP and potentiates RAS signalling to enhance p53 mediated apoptosis [2].")
    (p "As RAS is upstream of several signalling cascades [13], we queried whether the activity of ASPP2 is regulated by the activation of a RAS-mediated signalling pathway.")
    (p "One of the most studied downstream pathways of RAS signalling is the Raf-MAPK pathway.")
    (p "Interestingly, we observed two conserved putative MAPK phosphorylation sites in ASPP1 and ASPP2.")
    (p "The ASPP1 sites are at residues 671 and 746, and the ASPP2 sites are at residues 698 and 827.") ;; problem (Figure 1A).")
    (p "We thus tested whether RAS activation may regulate ASPP2 phosphorylation.")
    (p "An in vitro phophorylation assay was performed with a purified C-terminus fragment of ASPP2 (693-1128) containing both MAPK putative phosphorylation sites.")
    (p "When compared to p38 SAPK, MAPK1 was clearly able to phosphorylate the ASPP2 fragment in vitro (Figure 1B, left and middle panels).")
    (p "As shown in Figure S1, histone 2B phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had high levels of incorporated 32P, suggesting that p38 SAPK was active; while under the same conditions, ASPP2 (693-1128) fragment phosphorylated by p38 SAPK had very low levels of incorporated 32P, indicating that p38 SAPK is not an efficient kinase for ASPP2 phosphorylation.")
    (p "The phosphorylated ASPP2 fragment by MAPK1 was digested by trypsin and fractioned on a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).")
    (p "Each eluted fraction was measured for its radioactivity content (Figure 1B, right panel).")
    (p "The fractions representing these radioactive peaks were analysed by mass spectrometry.")
    (p "Of the two radioactive peaks, one represented the linker region between the GST and our ASPP2 fragment and the other corresponded to a fragment of the same mass as that containing the second putative phosphorylation site, serine 827.")
    (p "Hence ASPP2 can be phosphorylated at serine 827 by MAPK1 in vitro.")
    (p "A synthetic peptide encoding amino acids 824-832, with a phosphoserine at residue 827, was used to raise antibodies.")
    (p "A polyclonal antibody NGH.S4 was purified by affinity column purification.")
    (p "To test the efficacy of the purified phospho-specific antibody, a non-radioactive in vitro phosphorylation assay was performed on the purified GST-ASPP2 fragment (693-1128) with recombinant MAPK1.")
    (p "Figure 1C shows that the phospho- specific antibody is specific for the ASPP2 fragment phosphorylated in vitro by MAPK.")
    (p "To test whether endogenous ASPP2 could be phosphorylated in cells, Saos2 cells were grown in low serum for 50 hours to remove all background stimulation of RAS, after which the cells were stimulated with EGF and 20% fetal calf serum (FCS).")
    (p "Phosphorylated endogenous ASPP2 was detected by the phospho-specific antibody 30 minutes after RAS stimulation (Figure 1D).")
    (p "ASPP2 phosphorylation was rapid and transient as 3 hours after EGF stimulation phosphorylated ASPP2 was barely detectable.")
    (p "Moreover, with another different phospho-ASPP2 antibody, ES1, ASPP2 phosphorylation was also observed in a human colon cancer cell line HKe3 ER:HRASV12 cells, in which RAS activation is induced upon the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT).") ;;causes problems ;; [2,10,11] (Figure 1E).")
    (p "The phospho-specific antibody for ASPP2 is specific as knockdown of ASPP2 resulted in a lack of detection of phospho-ASPP2.")

    (p "Raf/MAPK Pathway Activates the Pro-Apoptotic Function of ASPP2.")
    (p "One of the most studied downstream pathways of RAS signalling is the Raf/MAPK pathway [13].")
    (p "Knowing ASPP2 is a substrate of MAPK, we thus tested whether activation of Raf/ MAPK pathway is sufficient to regulate ASPP2 activity using a mutant form of Raf (Raf CAAX), which is constitutively present at the plasma membrane, so the Raf pathway is constitutively active [14].")
    (p "The impact of co-expression of Raf CAAX with p53 and ASPP2 was tested by analysing the transcriptional activity of p53 on the pro-apoptotic Bax reporter.")
    (p "Raf CAAX increases Bax-luciferase levels by 2.5 fold over the baseline of p53 and ASPP2 alone.") ;; problems (P=0.05).")
    (p "This effect is likely to be mediated by ASPP2 as Raf CAAX had little effect on p53 in its absence (Figure 2A).")
    (p "The effect of Raf CAAX on ASPP2 and p53 was compared to that of HRAS V12 or KRAS V12.")
    (p "All three activate ASPP2 and p53 transactivation activity to a similar extent, namely 2.5 fold.") ;; problems (Figure 2B).")
    (p "This suggests that the effect of activated RAS on ASPP2 and p53 is mediated via the downstream Raf /MAPK pathway.")
    (p "ASPP2 phosphorylation by MAPK is necessary for ASPP2 full pro-apoptotic activity.")
    (p "To assess the effect of MAPK phosphorylation on ASPP2 activity, alanine substitution mutants of the two putative MAPK phosphorylation sites were constructed.")
    (p "In conditions where the cells were starved of serum, these mutants had identical activity to wild-type ASPP2 in their ability to enhance the transactivation function of p53 (Figure 3A).")
    (p "However, whereas activated Raf CAAX was able to stimulate wild-type ASPP2 and ASPP2 (S698A) by 2.5 fold, it was unable to increase the activity of mutant ASPP2 (S827A).") ;; problems (Figure 3B).")
    (p "These results suggest that MAPK phosphorylation of ASPP2 Ser827 is necessary for Raf CAAX to stimulate the full transcriptional activity of p53 via ASPP2.")
    (p "To determine the effect of MAPK phosphorylation on endogenous ASPP2 activity, cells were treated with a MAPK inhibitor, UO126.")
    (p "Inhibiting MAPK resulted in a significant decrease in the ability of ASPP2 to enhance the transcriptional activity of p53 compared to the control cells (Figure 3C), further validating the functional role of ASPP2 phosphorylation by MAPK.")
    (p "Moreover, another MAPK inhibitor, PD 98059, also inhibited ASPP2 function to a similar extent (Figure S2).")
    (p "Interestingly, the endogenous ASPP2 protein level was slightly decreased following RAS/MAPK pathway inhibition by UO126 treatment (Figure 3C, right panel) while RAS/MAPK pathway activation resulted in the increased ASPP2 expression (Figure 1E; Figure S3C).")
    (p "The mRNA level of ASPP2 was not affected upon RAS/MAPK pathway activation (Figure S3A), indicating that the regulation is not at the transcriptional level.")
    (p "Thus we investigated whether RAS/MAPK pathway activation could result in the increased protein stability of ASPP2.")
    (p "The ASPP2 protein levels in the presence or absence of oncogenic RAS were measured after cycloheximide (CHX) addition (Figure S3B and C).")
    (p "ASPP2 was a bit more stable when oncogenic RAS is induced in HKe3 ER:HRASV12 cells (Figure S3B) or co-transfected in Saos2 cells (Figure S3C): ASPP2 levels were considerably decreased without oncogenic RAS, while in the presence of HRAS V12, ASPP2 protein levels remained high after CHX treatment.")
    (p "These data indicate that ASPP2 phosphorylation by RAS/MAPK is necessary for ASPP2 full pro-apoptotic activity and this may be mediated by the stabilization of ASPP2 protein.")
    (p "Ser827 phosphorylation is required for RAS-induced translocation of ASPP2.")
    (p "It has recently been shown that activation of RAS results in ASPP2 translocation from the plasma membrane to the cytosol and nucleus [2].")
    (p "We therefore tested whether MAPK phosphorylation at Ser827 could affect the cellular localization of ASPP2.")
    (p "Interestingly, we observed that in contrast to wild type ASPP2, ASPP2 (S827A) remains at the plasma membrane following RAS activation by 4-OHT in the HKe3 ER:HRASV12 system (Figure 4A).")
    (p "This suggests that ASPP2 binding to RAS at the plasma membrane occurs prior to MAPK phosphorylation of ASPP2 and that Ser 827 phosphorylation is required for RAS-induced translocation of ASPP2 to the cytosol.")
    (p "As the translocation of wild-type ASPP2 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol and nucleus results in increased binding to p53 [2], we tested whether the p53 binding ability of ASPP2 phosphorylation mutant would be influenced by RAS activation.")
    (p "Indeed, upon activation of RAS by 4-OHT in HKe3 ER:HRASV12 cells, we observed an increase in the amount of p53 co-immunoprecipitated with transfected V5-tagged wild-type ASPP2 (Figure 4B, compare lanes 4 and 5).")
    (p "Under the same conditions, the amount of p53 in complex with transfected V5-ASPP2 (S827A) is not affected by RAS activation (Figure 4B, compare lanes 9 to 10).")

    (p "ASPP2 acts at several steps in promoting senescence in fibroblasts.")

    ;;(p "Additionally, it can bind active RAS directly leading to enhanced activation of c-Raf/ MAPK-mediated senescence [6].")

    (p "Until now, it has been unclear how RAS could affect ASPP2 to enhance p53 function.")
    (p "We show here that ASPP2 is phosphorylated by the RAS/Raf/MAPK pathway and that this phosphorylation leads to its increased translocation to the cytosol/nucleus and increased binding to p53, providing an explanation of how RAS can activate p53 pro-apoptotic functions (Figure 5).")
    (p "Additionally, RAS/Raf/MAPK pathway activation stabilizes ASPP2 protein, although the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated.")
    (p "Thus ASPP2 is both upstream of RAS, by binding active RAS and enhancing its downstream pathway activity, as well as downstream of the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway.")
    (p "It is likely that this possible feedback loop leads to an amplified pro-apoptotic signal.")
    (p "In a scenario where RAS is mutated and thereby constitutively active, it binds ASPP2, resulting in increased RAS/MAPK signaling.")
    (p "This in turn activates ASPP2 via MAPK phosphorylation which will translocate and activate p53 to promote apoptosis.")
    (p "ASPP2 will also continue to bind active RAS, thereby propagating the pro-apoptotic signal from RAS to p53.")
    (p "If RAS is only temporarily active, as happens in natural growth conditions, one could hypothesize that ASPP2 would bind active RAS, potentiate its downstream pathways, and MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of ASPP2 would lead to increased binding to p53.")
    (p "However, once RAS reverts to its inactive state, it would be unable to bind to ASPP2 and would therefore be unable to amplify the RAS signal to p53.")
    (p "Only in conditions where RAS is constitutively active would the ASPP2 feedback loop reach a threshold of signaling high enough to result in p53-dependent apoptosis.")
    (p "The ability of oncogenic RAS to stimulate apoptosis allows the cell to have a fail-proof mechanism: mutated RAS signals to p53 via ASPP2 to induce apoptosis instead of uncontrolled proliferation.")
