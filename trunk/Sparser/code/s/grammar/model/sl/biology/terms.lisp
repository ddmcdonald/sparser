;; Initiated 7/23/14 by lifting proteins from NFkappaB experiment.
;; Moved proteins out to their own file 9/8/14
;;; temporary home for rules
;;; gene  --> mutate gene
;;; enzyme --> bio-process enzyme
;;; move out oncoogene to taxonomy, and mutate to be a verb (so mutated is a past participle)
;; 11/9/14 hack for ', in part,' and terms for g1,...,g5, 'as a consequence' and .exchange' as a bio-process
