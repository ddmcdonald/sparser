;; Initiated 7/23/14 by lifting proteins from NFkappaB experiment.
;; Moved proteins out to their own file 9/8/14
;;; temporary home for rules
;;; gene  --> mutate gene
;;; enzyme --> bio-process enzyme
;;; move out oncoogene to taxonomy, and mutate to be a verb (so mutated is a past participle)
;; 11/9/14 hack for ', in part,' and terms for g1,...,g5, 'as a consequence' and .exchange' as a bio-process
;; added critical, common, "tumor formation", first stab at "form", revised "condition", revised "G-domain"
;; 12/8/14 Starting cell lines and drugs

(in-package :sparser)



;;--- Cell lines
; were expressed in HEK293T cells
; BRAF mutant thyroid cell lines
; HER2-amplified breast cancer cell lines
; breast carcinoma cell lines
; all six BRAF-mutant thyroid cancer cell lines
; increased basal HER3 in 8505C cells
; confirmed in a second cell line
; our panel of cancer cell lines (Figure 6A).
; the HCC827 NSCLC cell line



;;--- other things with clear markers
; the ZFN217 transcription factor
; and CtBP1/CtBP2 corepressors, CtBPs
; the HER3 promoter
; expression of HER3
; inhibition of HER3 transcription


;;--- Pathways
