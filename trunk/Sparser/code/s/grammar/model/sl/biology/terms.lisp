#| Importantly the signaling enzymes encoded by PIK3CA and BRAF are, in part,
regulated by direct binding to activated forms of the Ras proteins
suggesting that dysregulation of this key step in signaling is
critical for tumor formation. |#

;; "importantly"
;; An attribute of the entire fact, not the eventuallity

;; "signalling enzyme" 
;; A particular kind of enzyme specified by its function
;; See mechanics file for a hacked up version


#| This switch mechanism is common to a wide variety of GTP-binding
proteins and is mediated by a conserved structure called the G-domain
that consists of five conserved G boxes. |#
