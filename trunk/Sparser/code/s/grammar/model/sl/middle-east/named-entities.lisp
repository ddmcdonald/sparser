;;---- Patch up ordinary words
#|  The words in the companies that aren't otherwise defined in the load
will not automatically be pulled from Comlex when they're encountered in the text, 
e.g. "nuclear" in "nuclear scientist", because they are "known" words.
As a result they won't have any bracket information and we get segments like
... [nuclear] [scientist] ...

This code does the Comlex unpacking. I'm doing it by eye for any word
in any of the names that is not a pure "name" like Binyamin.

;;---- Months

;;some Iranian months from javan-online -- ordering is bogus because for that
;;  we'd have to look them up.
;;"the months that start on the 21st November and end on 20th January"
(define-month "Azar" 1)
(define-month "Dey" 2)
(define-month "Mordad" 3)

;;numbers precede months in european style
;;also used in javan-online.txt, an iranian news article
;;this is the rule we want, but there is an ordering issue
;;when parsing "21 Dey of the year 90"
;;the parser first merges "Dey" and "of the year 90" as a date
;;then the rule for amount -> number time kicks in
#|(def-cfr date (number month)
  :form np
  :referent (:instantiate-individual date
             :with (month right-edge day left-edge)))|#

;;instead we'll use this rule for now until that issue is fixed
(def-cfr date (number date)
  :form np
  :referent (:head right-edge
             :bind (day . left-edge)))
