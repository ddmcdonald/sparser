MIAMI (AP) -- Forecasters say Hurricane Adrian has strengthened to a powerful Category 4 storm off the Pacific coast of Mexico but is still expected to stay offshore.

Forecasters say maximum sustained winds for the first hurricane of the 2011 season increased Thursday evening to about 135 mph (217 kph).

The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami predicts that the storm's center will stay well offshore.

The center of the storm was about 320 miles (515 kilometers) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. It is moving west-northwest at 9 mph (14 kph).
