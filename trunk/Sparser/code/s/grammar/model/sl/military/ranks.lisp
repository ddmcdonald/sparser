;;;     File:  "ranks"
;;;   Module:  model/sl/military
;;;  version:  November 2012

;; Initiated 3/8/07. Added rules to compose the rank 3/22. Moved in to 
;; generic military and tweaked 11/24/12. Fixed abbreviations 11/30/12.

(in-package :sparser)

;; #1 Define the semantic category we're going to use for parsing
;;
(define-category military-rank
  :instantiates :self
  :binds ((name :primitive word)
	  (abbreviations  :primitive list))
  :realization (:common-noun name))

;; #2 Write a form that will let us take strings for particular ranks
;;  and make semantic grammar rules for them.  E.g.
;;       (define-military-rank "Captain" :abbreviations '("cpt"))
;;
;; Things to notice about this form:
;;   a. The 'define-individual' call instantiates the category in
;;      #1. The 'realization' specification in the category will
;;      take the string in the name (e.g. "Captain") and create
;;      a word for it with the part of speech 'noun' and a rule
;;      for it. 
;;   b. We're doing the same thing explicitly for each of the
;;      abbreviations. Notice that the rule (via define-cfr) has
;;      been given the syntactic form 'determiner' (like "a" or "the"),
;;      and its referent (what "cpt" is take to mean) is given at
;;      the object that we created for this particular rank.
;;
(defun define-military-rank (name &key abbreviations)
  (let ((obj (define-individual 'military-rank
	        :name name)))
    ;; N.b. earlier version marked the explicit rules that it created
    ;; for the abbreviations as being determiners. Does that matter?
    (when abbreviations
      (dolist (string abbreviations)
        (define-abbreviation name string :name-prefix)))
    obj))


;; #3 This form is what arranges for the export. Whenever we see an instance
;; of a person at toplevel ("treetop level") in the parse we'll put it
;; on the queue for exporting back to Java
;;
(set-generic-treetop-action category::person
			    'export-bindings/recursively)


;; #4 This is how we recognize people given a segment with otherwise
;; unknown words preceeded by an instance of a rank. It's drawing
;; on the person-creating facilities in Sparser.

;; #5 What's the relationship between a rank and a person. If had explicitly
;; modeled the notion of "member of the armed services" as a specialization of
;; person then this variable would already be part of their category, and
;; we would recast the person that we've heuristically recognized as this
;; more specific sort of person (who has a pay grade, belongs to a particular
;; unit, ...). This is the same sort of technique as is used with DSN numbers
;; and such.
