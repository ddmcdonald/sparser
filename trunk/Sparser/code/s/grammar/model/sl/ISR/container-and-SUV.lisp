#| Notes for Ford qua manufacturer of cars, 
thence as a make of car (vehicle) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford
Ford is a manufacturer
  what is manufactures is cars and trucks (farm equipment)
It creates artifacts,
  that concept licenses 'creator'{builder, assembler}
    and 'creation time' {birth date} 
      "came off the assembly line at <clock> on <date>"
It has buildings that it does its manufacturing in
 these are the place of the artifact creation

#| Notes on vehicle/car per se
A car has a 
  make -- who created it: Ford, Delorian, kit cars
  model -- a named configuration of car by a manufacturer
  year -- the year it was sold / was available for sale as a new car

'extent' -- what predicates does that license?
  size: height, width, diameter (not depth)

Honda is a car-manufacturer. It has a division called Acura (also a c-m)
Acura has a car-model called the TSX, which had different features
depending on the model-year. I bound a instances of the 2004 Acura TSX,
which is now in good to excellent condition (terms from Kelly Blue Book)
with a very small number of scratches and cracks.
