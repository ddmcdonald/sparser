a container is a place, preposition = "in"

#| Notes on vehicle/car per se
A car has a 
  make -- who created it: Ford, Delorian, kit cars
  model -- a named configuration of car by a manufacturer
  year -- the year it was sold / was available for sale as a new car

'extent' -- what predicates does that license?
  size: height, width, diameter (not depth)

Honda is a car-manufacturer. It has a division called Acura (also a c-m)
Acura has a car-model called the TSX, which had different features
depending on the model-year. I bound a instances of the 2004 Acura TSX,
which is now in good to excellent condition (terms from Kelly Blue Book)
with a very small number of scratches and cracks.
