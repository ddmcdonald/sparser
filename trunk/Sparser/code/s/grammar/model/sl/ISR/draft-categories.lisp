#| Notes for Ford qua manufacturer of cars, 
thence as a make of car (vehicle) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford
Ford is a manufacturer
  what is manufactures is cars and trucks (farm equipment)
It creates artifacts,
  that concept licenses 'creator'{builder, assembler}
    and 'creation time' {birth date} 
      "came off the assembly line at <clock> on <date>"
It has buildings that it does its manufacturing in
 these are the place of the artifact creation
