;; initiated 1/91
;; 1.0 (9/7/92 v2.3) flushed out of date field references
;; 1.1 (5/14/93) changed to using Set-used-by as a field-setter
;; 5/25/2015 added call to place-referent-in-lattice around computation of edge-referent field
;;  initial work to produce a lattice of descriptions
;;  the places where this call is put were determined by the methods where (complete edge) was also called
