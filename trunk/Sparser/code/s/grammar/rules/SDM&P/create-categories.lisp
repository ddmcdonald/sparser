;; Initiated 2/9/07. Elaborated through 8/6. Refactored the head form
;; elevator 2/4/08. Added cases through 4/24, then through 6/16.
;; 8/14/08 Fell through the assumption that there would be a form category
;; to elevate: edge over a period in Danio paragraph running under fire
;; settings. (2/10/10) Considered extending reify-segment-head-if-needed
;; for the case of literal words in rules, but it lead to coniptions with "."
;; 0.2 4/17/10 Uppercase category names were returning nil. Changed 
;;  elevation of segment edge of verb cases to vg from VP. 
;;  (1/23/12) cleaned up. Trying to find duplication. 4/1/13 found it.
;;  (4/14/14) Added case to generalize-segment-edge
