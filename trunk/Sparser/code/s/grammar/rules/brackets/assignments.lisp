;; Extracted from diverse files 12/4/12. Added referent construction
;; 12/11/12. Revised those 'setup' constructors 2/23/13 to specialize
;; the category names when words come in more than one part of speech,
;; and to trap constructed categories that have the same name as
;; one that already exists to cut down of weird definition changes.
;; 2/28/13 included primitive way to tell the provinance of the
;; categories we make here. 6/14/14 Broke out the backet lists as
;; independent parameters that the assign functions map over. 
;; 7/27/14 Slightly factored the set-xx routines to use with affix morph.
;; 8/29/14 Made the errors for already defined categories into cerrors
;; 4/27/15 added *break-on-pattern-outside-coverage?* to the duplicate
;;  checks.
