;; 3.0 (10/2/92 v2.3) tweeked interactions with scan as that routine
;;      was broken down into smaller parts.
;; 3.1 (12/29) integrated capitalization checks
;; 4.0 (3/11/93) put in the capacity to handle multiple completions
;;      and put in a switch so the hairy version doesn't have to be
;;      used in :topmost-edges
;;     (5/6) finishing that routine
;; 4.1 (10/29) updated the checks against status.
;; 4.2 (4/4/94) added another case that 'status' can be in, added checks for
;;      subsuming known capitalized variants.
;; 4.3 (7/22) changed status check in Extend-mc-pw
;; 4.4 (8/1) elaborated mix-case check to allow competion of lc's as a default if the
;;      specific case doesn't complete
;;     (8/4/91) added field for the rule to the edges these form
;; 5.0 (5/19/15) Complete make-over as a FSA.
