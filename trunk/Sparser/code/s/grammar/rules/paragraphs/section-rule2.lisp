;;;   Module:  "grammar;rules:paragraphs:"
;;;  Version:   2.4 March 2010

;; initiated 8/90
;; 1.1 (10/26/91 v2.0) completely overhauled.
;;     (10/28) put in temporary hack for w::paragraph-start
;;     (7/13/92 v2.2) Inserted traces on *trace-paragraphs*
;; 1.2 (1/4/93 v2.3) made adjustments now that they're actually being used
;; 1.3 (1/13/94) added a global pointing to the section marker, and a flag
;;      to the start routine so it will call finish-para when there's no
;;      section-marker involved.
;; 1.4 (5/9/94) hooking it in to the different calling patter from sgml tags
;; 2.0 (8/17) accomodated to shift to section-objects
;; 2.1 (11/30) Adapted the section-object management code to index the object
;;      into the discourse history
;; 2.2 (1/5/95) sharpened coordination when there's no ongoing paragraph
;; 2.3 (1/1/96) put in a style flag to indicate that the paragraph markup is
;;      not paired and so the pause-check has to be done here.
;;     (1/9) added If-there-never-were-any-sections-do-after-para-actions
;; 2.4 (3/16/10) Folded in extension for prior/after pointers, reverted to the
;;      struct to avoid PSI propblems.
