;;;     File:  "object"
;;;   Module:  "grammar;rules:paragraphs:"
;;;  Version:  2.2 December 2010

;; 1.1 (10/25/93 v2.0) [-> "1"]  New design for section markers
;; 1.2 (1/5/94 v2.3) fleshing out the object now that it's being used
;; 1.3 (1/14) wrote a nicer print routine
;;     (5/2) added Print-paragraph-#
;; 2.0 (8/17) converted to section-objects.
;; 2.1 (3/16/10) Converted them back to avoid PSI hassles. Added next-paragraph.
;; 2.2 (12/5/10) Renamed the struct to avoid clash with the CLOS class backing the
;;      form category named paragraph. Calling it paragraph-structure, which
;;      isn't all that unnatural. Propagated changes through this file.
