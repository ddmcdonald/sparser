;; initiated 10/22/93 v2.3.  Added def-rule data 3/8/95.
;; Converted uninteresting "+" to a "-" 5/2.  Added instantiation of
;; 'result' 3/11/05. 4/3/13 Added family for just the tag parts.
;; 6/6/14 Removed the tag and late-complement options from that-complement
;; because they didn't seem to generalize and the commented out use of
;; this ETF in sl/reports/object.lisp said that it was too aggressive.
;; 11/21/14 Cleared out the deadwood.

;; For "report", especially when there's not a parse for the complement
;;   and you want a stub to que off of.
