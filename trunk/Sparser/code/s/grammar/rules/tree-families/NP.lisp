;; initiated 8/31/92 v2.3
;; 0.1 (6/2/93) added explicit definitions for the mix-in category
;; 0.2 (6/12) added definites
;; 0.3 (4/29/94) broke out definites so they could be incorporated by other ETFs
;;  (3/7/95) added 'schema-type' fields
;;  (8/11) added np-common-noun/indefinite by copying out those cases
;;   from np-common-noun.  ///This cries out for definiing that one as
;;   the result of two incorporations, but don't have the time to check
;;    whether that would automatically work or need some effort.
;; 0.4 (12/27/99) Added head fields to every rule. (3/16/05) cleaned up
;;  the indenting, added np-common-noun/intrinsically-definite. (3/17) trying
;;  to sort this all out, since it's becoming counterintuitive with "the board"
;;  and now "a <title>".
;; 0.5 (4/13/09) Removed the n-bar cases in np-common-noun/definite and
;;  np-common-noun because they were gratuitously creating multiple rule
;;  applicability given how they were written. Also removed the subtyping
;;  of indefinite.
;; 0.6 (6/19/09) Added possessive mixin and possessive schemas for the 
;;  np-common-noun ETF.
;;     (7/16/09) Modified possessive schemas so that the pronouns are not
;;       discarded.
;; 0.7 (9/21/09) Broke out the possessive pronouns from np-common-noun into
;;  their own (extending) ETF to allow for earlier (reasonable) uses of 
;;  np-common-noun where there's no modifier slot. 
;;  (2/20/11) Added initial listing comment. Fixed it 3/9. Annotating a bit
;;   to help sort out what to use 7/25/11, also removed commented out or OBE
;;   bits and added definite mixin category for np-common-noun/definite by
;;   analogy to the indefinite ETF.
;;  (9/8/11) Found the defNP stuff so put the ETF back in.

(define-exploded-tree-family  np-common-noun/intrinsically-definite

#| This is a funny one that has to be considered still very much in flux
 since I'm tuning it to "the board (of directors)" and that's probably quite
 ideosyncratic. In that category, we start with a common-noun rspec to
 get an edge over "board" that links it to the category, then we use
 this schema to soak up the definite article, which is presumed to have
 no semantic import. |#
