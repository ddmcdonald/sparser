;; initiated 4/28/94 v2.3
;; 0.1 (10/20) refined some of the distinctions amoung cases
;;     (12/29) added classifier-head/of/prep
;; 0.2 (2/22/95) started adding description strings
;; 0.3 (4/14) removed inclusion of def-np etf
;;     (7/26) added modifier-creates-subtype
;; 0.4 (8/11) modified  def+proper+np-head to use np-common-noun/DEFINITE,
;;      leaving out the indefinites.  11/15 added some definitions.
;; 0.5 (12/22) added a hyphen to modifier-creates-definite-individual to handle
;;      "first-quarter" - it overgenerates in the case of multiple mappings.
;; 0.6 (3/29/96) Added modifier-creates-individual and descriptions for its relatives.
;; 0.7 (7/12/98) Added definite-proper+np-head.
;;     (7/13) tweaked modifier-creates-individual to use subtype.
;;     (6/25/99) added number-of-quantity.
;;     (4/29/00) added quantity-of-kind.  (7/8) tweaked doc. and added
;;      designated-instance-of-set.  (2/9/05) adjusted modifier-creates-subtype so it
;;      would really make a subtype. (3/11/05) Added two possessive etf.
;;     (3/29/06) fixed :function referent in number-of-quantity. For unknown reasons
;;      it wasn't a list and it blocked the load.
;; 0.8 (8/8/11) Added a form-based modifier.
;;     (1/5/13) Removed common-noun/plural case from generic-np-premodifier because
;;      decode-rdata-mapping was taking it to be a slashed category. ///Check whether
;;      we'd ever get a form category of that name.
;;     (5/22/14) Added modifier-creates-instance

#|  "(a) Worlco director"  "(the) Worlco directors"  "(the) Worlco CEO"
    "(the) CEO of Worlco"   "(a) director at Worlco"

Cite: 13.57 of Quirk et al. (Brown)  pg.914
  "a rod of iron"             "an iron rod"
  "the door of the cupboard"  "the cupboard door"
  "the shooting of tigers"    "tiger shooting"
  "a story about the war"     "a war story"
  "a cloth for dishes"        "a dish cloth"
  "a village in Sussex"       "a Sussex village"
  "a man from Sussex"         "a Sussex man"

These things verge on being compound nouns.

These would be of/genitive except that
  (1) the relationship between the two items is arbitrary
  (2) the premodifier form is not possessive (probably because the
      resulting individual doesn't have to be specific)

  The modifier provides enough information to change the type
    of the phrase (though that construal might be part of my
    analysis of 'position' and not general -- all of Quirk's examples
    remain with the type of the head).
  The modifier is a noun (or n-bar, proper noun, etc.)
  Both the head and modifier carry information.
  Whether a determiner is needed is probably a function of the
    head, but I need more examples to be sure.  |#
