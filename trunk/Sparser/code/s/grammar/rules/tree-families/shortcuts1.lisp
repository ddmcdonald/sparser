;; Started 4/3/09. Modeled on [model;core:kinds:object] Modified
;; 7/16/09: added modifier to np-head Modified 7/21/09: replaced
;; 'where' in sv-location with 'location' to avoid inconsistency in
;; output Modified 7/23/09: added additional bootstrap rule to svo to
;; treat "it" as an individual, also added spatial-orientation to
;; sv-location, and interjection 9/21/09 Renaming ETF in
;; np-head. Fanout from also loading more diverse set of nps. 2/16/10
;; Added synonyms code. 8/8/11 Working out a macro to generate 'type'
;; categories. 9/6 folded :rule-label into the macro. 9/23 adjusted
;; adverbials to fit changes to the ETF. 9/26 expunged spatial-orientation
;; by removing sv-spatial-prep-marked-o (which had no applications) and
;; making sv-location mostly meaningless by duplicating the problematic
;; case. 8/19/13 Added head-noun as first of possibly many short-cuts
;; for already defined categories. 1/30/14 Started cleaning them up. 
;; 5/28/14 Pulled the rule-adders to uniform place. 6/4/14 added vo. 
;; 6/6/14 Worked out a set of macros to make shortcuts more consistent
;; and compact. 6/9/14 Starting make over, including removing shortcuts
;; that are only used in sl/checkpoint/vocabulary.lisp. 9/14/14 pulled
;; out the macros to their own file. 11/7/14 added a :prehead-modifier
;; standalone rule to svo/passive/nominal. 
;; remove broken new rule for vo/passive/nominal/expr.
;; 1.0 1/5/15 Radical overhaul to make things uniform by taking the
;;  full set of parameters. Also to remove dead wood.

#| We need models for single words (like countries), for words
that are head of relations (like "increase"), and for some combinations
(like adjective+adverb). In every case we are creating a category
based on the word, with a superclass and the set of slots (variables) 
they require. All of that can be specified, or else a reasonable set
of defaults will be used. There is also the possibility of mixins, 
overriding the rule label, distinguishing the category name, and
broadly speaking doing for you all the things you might do by hand.
