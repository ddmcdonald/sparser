;;;  version:  1.9 November 2012

;; initiated 8/31/92 v2.3, fleshing out verb rules 10/12
;; 0.1 (11/2) fixed how lists of rules formed with synonyms
;; 0.2 (5/25/93) added a parameter to the drivers to distinguish categories
;;      from referents to accomodate the case of rules specific to individuals
;;      and added rule for "y -> ies" plurals
;; 0.2 (6/6) added rule in ed and ing forms to drop final "e"
;; 0.3 (6/10) put in plurals for polywords
;; 0.4 (6/18) added ].verb brackets to the verbs
;; 0.5 (10/22) tweeked common-noun to not pluralize punctuation
;; 0.6 (10/25) modified verbs and common nouns to accept specialized morphology
;; 0.7 (5/26) added 'deictic time words' and adverbs
;; 0.8 (6/7) collected all the verb bracket assignment into one routine
;;     (7/12) piggybacked on that to define Verb?
;; 0.9 (10/19) switched from 'deictic-time' to 'standalong-word'
;;     (12/1) added some predicates.  1/9 added Word-stem as :ls-stem
;;     (1/23) added Adverb?
;; 0.10 (4/14) finished known cases of Form-stem/strip-ed. 4/19 fixed missing
;;       case in ed-form-of-word for "join" -> "joinned" bug.
;;      (5/14) fixed weak dispatch in Make-verb-rules
;;      (6/13) added plural-head?
;; 0.11 (12/8) added an override to Make-rules-for-word-w/o-morph to take its rule
;;       category from the 'instantiates' of the category if they're different.
;;       12/11 did it to common-noun as well. 12/12 Backed out of the w/o-morph
;;       version because it clobbered pronouns becase they depended on the specificity
;; 0.12 (1/2/96) added string-to-word conversions to Make-verb-rules/aux2
;; 0.13 (1/16) blocked the 'subtype' in Make-cn-rules/aux
;;      (7/22) added a check in Make-rules-for-word-w/o-morph for the case of the
;;       'word' coming in as a string rather than a word. The real problem is almost
;;       certainly with the caller though.  (8/4) found the real problem and fixed it.
;; 0.14 (5/5/98) added a binding of *schema-being-instantiated* to Make-verb-rules/aux2.
;; 1.0  (10/10/99) Started adding references to schematic-rules when the concrete
;;       rules are created. Moved the dispatch into here from driver1.
;;      (11/25) Modified standalone-word to use a schematic format. (11/26) added the
;;       rest except for verbs since I'm pretty sure I don't remember all the
;;       context that went into their design. 
;;       Also left out common nouns because didn't want to do the proper design
;;       for plurals quite yet. (12/26) put schema reference into Make-cn-rules/aux
;;       so kinds would at least turn over if not have subtypes with open variables for
;;       the plurals.
;; 1.1  (3/18/00) Turned on the plural subtyping in Make-cn-rules/aux
;;      (7/11/00) Added quantifier
;; 1.2  (1/2/01) revised the plural subtyping in Make-cn-rules/aux to be simple.
;;      (2/18) fixed a typo in it.
;; 1.3  (3/31/05) Modified the call that makes the nominalized form of the verb in
;;       Make-verb-rules/aux2 to allow for it having the same pname as another case.
;;       If we didn't we wouldn't get the nominalized rule.
;;      (4/23/08) Added assign-brackets-as-a-common-noun for Make-cn-rules/aux.
;;      (4/14/09) Added *valid-keywords-for-irregular-word-forms*
;;      (7/23/09) Added interjection.
;; 1.4 (9/1/09) Modified plural rule for common nouns to just go to its referent rather
;;      than form a subtype of the referent. We're not doing subtypes right now, but it
;;      needs to be generalized when getting "external" referents as in the link to
;;      Poirot. Modified plural-version of common nouns to just as "s" to words ending
;;      in "y" when they satisfy one-syllable? -- "days". (9/6) Fixed the brackets on
;;      standalone-word.
;; 1.5 (10/13/09) Modified the w/o-morph case to not laydown any brackets and added
;;      explicit set (with brackets) for adjectives.
;; 1.6 (11/4/10) Earlier in October added vast amount to the stemming capabilities.
;;      Today resurecting define-main-verb entry point from 1993 JV work.
;; 1.7 (3/14/11) Decided I wanted more rope for hanging myself and decided that
;;      the :instantiates field of a category (which the ancient doc says, and it's
;;      true the last time I looked, governs the category an individual is indexed
;;      under in the discourse history) should now also govern the lhs of the
;;      rewrite rules. 7/11/11 Spruced up define-main-verb a bit. 7/12 fixed ing-
;;      form-of-verb for cases like "wait" or "gain".
;;      7/31 Added 'category' keyword to define-main-verb so can be used by primed verbs
;; 1.8 (8/1/11) Refactoring a bit so can operate on strings when priming a background
;;      lexicon. 8/2 added the code for recording inflections/lemmas.
;; 1.9 (9/6/11) Rationalized the 'rope' to split discourse history effects from
;;      lhs labeling with the function override-label, which originates in a new
;;      field, :rule-label, on categories. 
;; 1.10 (9/13/11) modified assign-brackets-as-a-common-noun to leave off the
;;      np]. bracket.  4/2/12 #ignored noun/verb-ambiguous?  11/25/12 1st case of
;;      lists of strings in the irregulars past in to define-main-verb.
