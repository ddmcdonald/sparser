;;;  version:  1.0 December 2014

;; Initiated 9/14/14 to make more flexible, complete shortcuts.
;; 11/11/14 added keyword for obo-id.
;; 1.0 (12/13/14) totally made over to simplify everything down
;;  to one two routines. 1/5/15 Refactored a bit to handle
;;  nouns and adjectives without ETF.

#| The target is a call to apply-realization-scheme or an open-coded equivalent.
The key part is the mapping, which is constructed by assemble-scheme-form which
takes the arg-to-substitute that were assembled as special-case combinations
in the def-term routines (e.g. def-subj-theme-term). 

The map of the schema, e.g.
(define-realization-scheme svo transitive
  :head :verb
  :mapping ((agent . subj-slot)
            (patient . theme-slot)
            (s . :self)
            (vp . :self)
            (vg . :self)
            (np/subject . subj-v/r)
            (np/object . theme-v/r)))

Is specialized by the values provided by the def-term routine, e.g.
     :args `((subj-slot . ,subj-slot)
             (theme-slot . ,theme-slot)
             (subj-v/r . ,subj-v/r)
             (theme-v/r . ,theme-v/r)))

The schema of the etf expect at mapping from their parameters and labels
to variables (for the parameters) and categories (for the labels). 
Or to the category of the realization (for :self) or a word for any string.

The cdr's of the schema maps coresppond to the car's of the driver's map.
The process in assemble-schema-form is driven by walking down the schema's
map, pair by pair. So we have to have all of the terms that the schema
expects, but we could have more if we wanted.
