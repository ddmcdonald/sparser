;; initiated 3/9/05
;; 0.1 (5/20/09) Added verb+ing and verb cases to pre-verb-adverb
;; 0.2 (8/8/11) Finished the cases with the other form options for verbs
;;     and added post-verb-adverb
;; 0.3 (9/23/11) Converting the referents to a method application. 11/5/12
;;     correcting it's spelling, since in syntax/adverbs1 the method is
;;     "modified'

(in-package :sparser)

#| ETFs in this file:

     pre-verb-adverb ------------ "today announced"
     post-verb-adverb ----------- "announced today"
     sentence-adverb ------------ pre/post S & VP
     pre-adj-adverb ------------- "incredibly useful"
     pre-adv-adverb ------------- "very slowly"

;; The cases in these tree families all produce form rules, where the
;; adverb is the concrete category and the heads are all form categories.
;; There are no assumptions about the structure of the head in the
;; referents. Instead everything is mediated by the CLOS method
;; named modified, which can be specialized by both the adverb and
;; the head. See base cases in rules/syntax/adverbs1.lisp.

;; The modified method's arguments are <modifier>, <modifiers>, so the
;; adverb edge has to be first in the call, and the head second.
