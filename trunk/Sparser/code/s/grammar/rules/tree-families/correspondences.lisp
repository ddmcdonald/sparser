;; initiated 10/5/09. Expanded 11/10. 
;; (12/9/10) Reworking most of this to bring it in sync what what rnodes
;;  encode.
;; 0.2 (1/25/11) Removed need to check against core-omar.
;;     (3/22/11) Starting to populate it. Continuing through 4/8/11.
;; 0.3 (4/22/12) The defvar doesn't cleanly update in Clozure so switched
;;      to hashtable on the etf.

#|  Read by mumble::map-etf-to-dtn 
  in /Mumble/derivation-trees/conversions.lisp

Structure is an alist on the nuame of the etf accessed by has-mumble-mapping?

For a simple case of a phrase, it's
   (<etf name> <name of mumble phrase> <arg mapping>)
When we need adjunction, it's
   (<etf name> :adjoin <nome of AP>
      <arg going to base> <arg to be adjoined>)
