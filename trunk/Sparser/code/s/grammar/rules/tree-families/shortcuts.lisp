;; Started 4/3/09. Modeled on [model;core:kinds:object] Modified
;; 7/16/09: added modifier to np-head Modified 7/21/09: replaced
;; 'where' in sv-location with 'location' to avoid inconsistency in
;; output Modified 7/23/09: added additional bootstrap rule to svo to
;; treat "it" as an individual, also added spatial-orientation to
;; sv-location, and interjection 9/21/09 Renaming ETF in
;; np-head. Fanout from also loading more diverse set of nps. 2/16/10
;; Added synonyms code. 8/8/11 Working out a macro to generate 'type'
;; categories. 9/6 folded :rule-label into the macro. 9/23 adjusted
;; adverbials to fit changes to the ETF. 9/26 expunged spatial-orientation
;; by removing sv-spatial-prep-marked-o (which had no applications) and
;; making sv-location mostly meaningless by duplicating the problematic
;; case. 8/19/13 Added head-noun as first of possibly many short-cuts
;; for already defined categories. 1/30/14 Started cleaning them up. 
;; 5/28/14 Pulled the rule-adders to uniform place.
