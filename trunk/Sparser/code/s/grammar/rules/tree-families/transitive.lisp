;; initiated 8/5/92 v2.3, added passives 8/24
;; 0.1 (10/13) reorganized (in)transitive to fit the paper
;; 0.2 (8/3/93) changed label on trans/passive to give the schema
;;      exploration routine something to look for.
;;     (7/23/98) Added transitive/new-head
;;     (6/26/07) Added transitive/pp
;; 0.3 (1/29/08) In intransitive, changed the vg to vp
;;     (4/20/09) moved transitive/pp to verbs-taking-pps in order to specialize it
;;     (8/7/11) moved in transitive-location, which isn't all that well designed.
