;;;  version:  0.1 April 2011

;; initiated 6/14/95.  8/11 added pp-after-np.  11/15 added premodifier-adds-
;; property and filled in a missing description.  12/5 added determiner-adds-property
;; 0.1 (3/13/96) revised pp-after-np to have it assume the pp is already define
;;      rather than form it as part of doing the schema -- case label decoding
;;      was overly complicated to hack without better motivation.
;; (10/29/00) Cataloged what's here and added N-per-unit. 12/11 fixed a bug where
;;   the parens were layered wrong. 12/22 fixed spelling of keyword. 2/17/05 added
;;   np-participle. 4/1 Modified pp-after-np to include the preposition in a simplistic
;;   way. 4/4/11 Added np-and-postmodifier

#| ETFs in this file:

     premodifier-creates-subtype --- "net income" ?? look at binding pattern
     np-and-postmodifier ----------- "60 in February" Instantiates a new individual
     premodifier-adds-property ----- "red house"
     appositive -------------------- "Patrick Courtin, president and CEO of Gensym Corporation"
     np-participle ----------------- "third quarter ended June 26, 2004"
     pp-after-np ------------------- the pp adds a property. "of" is a special case
                                        in its own file.
     N-per-unit -------------------- "10 cents a {per} share", "$125 an hour", "(grows by) an inch a year"
