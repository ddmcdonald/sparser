;; formed 10/26/94 from [of genitive] and [group of type]. Added def-rule data 3/8/95
;; 7/13/98 added item-of-value. 7/8/00 added member-of.
;; (4/11/03) cloned item-of-value to item-of-value1 which has an instantiate-individual
;;  instruction in it -- otherwise "sales of $98.3 billion" won't work as an
;;  instance of an ern since that's based on psi.
;;  4/7/11 Addded of-complement. 8/18 added dependent-of. 8/26 fixed referent in
;; simple-of-complement. 9/26 reordered cases to make postprocessing happy, also
;; modified dependent-of so that the head and daughter would both pickout
;; the same edge, even if it doesn't make all that much sense.
;; 2/28/13 added kind-of-name. 7/23/13 added empty-head-of-complement
