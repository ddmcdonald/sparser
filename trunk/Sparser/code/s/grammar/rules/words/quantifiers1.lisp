;;;      File:   "quantifiers"
;;;    Module:   "grammar;rules:words:"
;;;   Version:   1.7 April 2013

;; broken out from "fn words - cases" 12/17/92 v2.3.  Added some 1/13/94
;; 0.1 (7/25) revised "many" and "several" to be like the others rather than
;;      just having a ].phrase bracket
;; 0.2 (8/16) gave "not" a tentative bracketing   9/6 "{some,any,every}one", "much"
;; 1.0 (11/16) giving some of them all default edges so dm&p can generalize over them
;;      The ones that stand alone are still problematic.
;;     (12/5) added "additional"
;; 1.1 (8/16/97) gated the use of objects. 
;; 1.2 (12/26/99) redid the category with modern indexing scheme. (Haven't touched
;;      the def form yet.)
;;     (2/8/07) Removed toplevel check around the definition of the category - see note.
;; 1.3 (6/9/08) Made everything a quantifier, providing more rule options.
;;     (11/14) Added 'as xx as' phrase as quantifiers, which is a good fit syntactically
;; 1.4 (2/10/10) Revised the ]. bracket to be specific to quantifier to adjudicate correctly
;;      for np-internal instances: "a few ...".
;; 1.5 (8/30/11) Adding more form cases to the quantifier rule. 8/31 Added a rule
;;      for the word itself to give it the quantifier object as a referent.
;;     (5/17/12) Discovered a bunch of ordinary quantifiers were stranded in the
;;      other version of this file. 
;; 1.6 (11/2/12) Du'h the rules as written to rewrite a word as the saem word are circular.
;;      redoing them on the pattern of preposition. 11/30/12 fixed "no"
;; 1.7 (4/8/13) Made "not" look like an auxiliary

 This creates an object for the quantifier, an individual created
 from the quantiifer category just below. This is the hook that lets
 us (eventually) create a real quantification machanism using a full
 version of what's in /rules/syntax/quantifiers.lisp.
   1. We define the word as a function word with form and brackets.
   2. Create a category based on the name of the word to be the rule label
      that will largely operate by form rules
   3. Write a rule that rewrite to the constructed category with
      the quantifier individual as its referent. 
   4. We look at the rules field and build them as specified
    A. 'det' -- the quantifier acts as a determiner. We write a form rule 
 against noun and np that call the quantify method to convert the
 referent into an instance of quantified (/// which isn't really right
 since it's still an instance of what it is, but now it has this
 extra type. Same technical problem of modality or hedging at the
 clause level
    B. 'of' -- the word is typically followed by 'of'. See note in
 code. ///this loses the partitioning aspect of the quantification.
