;;;   Module:  "grammar;rules:words:"
;;;  Version:  1.0 September 2010

;; initiated 5/16/93 v2.3. Populated 1/11/94. Added to 1/12,1/13
;; 0.1 (5/26) redid the bracket label as 'adverb'
;; 0.2 (1/30/95) redid the adverb-adverbs as 'phrase' rather than 'adverb'
;;      to block triggering vg-mining of the segments they start
;; 0.3 (4/12) redone as 'define-adverb', etc.
;; 0.4 (10/13) redefined Define-adverb and moved it to [syntax;adverbs]
;;     (4/24/08) added more words. Moved in the category and def form
;;      from rules/syntax/adverbs to make this file more in the style
;;      of words/quantifies1, largely to keep "despite" from being spanned
;;      as a head noun because the 'adverb' aspect isn't introducing
;;      an edge. 
;;     (2/3/10) removed "few" since it should really be taken as a quantifier
;;     (2/10) Gave "too" and "very" ].adverb brackets: "a very small ..."
;; 1.0 (9/16/11) Very thorough make over now that methods are available.
