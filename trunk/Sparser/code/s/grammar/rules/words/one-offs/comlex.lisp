;; initiated 8/16/10. 11/3 cleaned up the loader. Added vivifying code.
;; 7/10/11 started finishing it. 7/28 Decided to use priming system
;; instead where we wait for the word to be seen before we expand it.
;; 3/1/12 fixed C&S eror. 10/15/12 Hooked up prime-comlex to the local
;; file. 10/30/12 added a flag to indicate that priming has been done.
;; Continued tweaks through 11/8.

#|
 The lists in the various tables (e.g *is-a-function-word-in-comlex*)
or the simple lists themselves (*comlex-verbs-list*) contain symbols,
sometimes multiword symbols (e.g. |in case of|). They can be converted
to words and given bracketing assignments. When working on generic
texts this is most important for verbs.

  If we wanted to instantiate the words as, e.g. /dossiers/semantics-
free-verbs, and especially if we knew their subcategorization pattern,
then we could use forms like "svo" (/rules/tree-families/shortcuts),
but the last time we did that it took eons to load everything because
of the hashtable manipulation in the machinery for handling individuals.
Better to leave them uninstantiated until we know something about them
e.g. via DM&P or Fire.
