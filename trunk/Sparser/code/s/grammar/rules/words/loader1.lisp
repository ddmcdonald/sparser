;;;   Version:   1.9 September 2011

;; initiated 2/1/91, added "other adverbs" & "vague" 2/12, added
;;    "conjunctions" 2/20, added scheme for function words and
;;    some cases 3/20, 4/23 added contractions.  11/17 elevated
;;    format1 as [spaces], 12/28 put in the load flags
;; 1.0 (9/7/92 v2.3) bumped this file to shadow some files for
;;      conversion to the new semantics
;; 1.1 (9/21) pulled the punctuation file out to the masterloader
;;      for coordination with populating the dispatch array for the
;;      tokenizer
;; 1.2 (12/4) cleaning up the loading and module control
;; 1.3 (12/17) made submodules for kinds of function words
;; 1.4 (5/6/93) added [aux verbs] from syntax;
;; 1.5 (3/17/94) moved in [punctuation bracketing] from bracket assignments
;; 1.6 (11/16) bumped [quantifiers] to 1.  12/12 added *brackets* gate to punct.
;;     (1/9/95) added [adjectives].
;; 1.7 (1/30) bumped [prepositions] to 1
;; 1.8 (10/14/99) bumped it to 2 contingent on this being a load with the model
;; 1.9 (9/16/11) moved out adverbs to loader-part2 because they're creating
;;      categories now. Others might follow. 9/29/11 Moved prepositions over.
