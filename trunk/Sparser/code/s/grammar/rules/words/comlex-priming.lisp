;; Extracted from one-offs/comlex 12/3/12.
;; 0.1 (8/12/13) Wrapped the eval of the def-word expression in an
;;      ignore-errors because the mlisp load in my ACL 8.2 was choking
;;      on unicode characters in French words.
;; 0.2 (8/7/14) Rewrote prime-word-from-comlex to do away with the
;;      original notion that we did not prime a word if (word-named string)
;;      wasn't nil. That's already stronger than the check in unknown-word? 
;;      which looks for a rule set. Now we want the subcategorization
;;      information for all the words, 'known' or not, so we need to prime
;;      them all even though we will often not be using that scheme in
;;      the word lookup and object creation. 
;;     (9/11/14) moved out the subcategorization stub.
