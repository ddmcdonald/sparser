;;;  Version:  0.5 February 2014

;; initiated 10/90
;; 3/21/92 Added capitalization information to the dummy words
;; (1/11/94 v2.3) modernized it all
;; 0.1 (6/12) switch'ified the runtime word-checking routine.
;; 0.2 (2/27/95) cleaned up loose ends.
;;     (6/26/96) moved from [analyzers;doc:] to [grammar;rules:words:]
;; 0.3 (6/9/10) Hacking *current-article* so we can to tf/idf analyses
;; 0.4 (6/19/10) Folding in Porter Stemmer. 6/30 tweaking that and the
;;     printers. 7/15/10 implementing tracking freq in different documents.
;;     7/23-25 folding in #<document> object. Refining ...8/16.
;;     7/28/11 Abstracted out def-word to its own file. 3/31/12 fixed fn call.
;;     Through August, September 2012 adding documentation, refining
;;     the code overall. 10/24/13 Started stubbing a document-set driver.
;; 0.5 (10/28/13) Fanout from the make-over of the document classes.
;;     (2/3/14) Some further change required redoing the scope of the
;;     call to stem in wf-classification/ignore-caps
