;; initiated 4/26/91, extended 4/28,10/2
;; Required assignments to the source start/end pulled 11/24
;; (12/17/92 v2.3) pulled the assignments on function words
;;  and moved them to there [words;] files.  1/11/94 added more cases
;; 0.1 (7/26) moved assignments to apostrophe-s to [rules;FSAs:single quote]
;; 0.2 (3/18/05) Gave ".", "?", and "!" a .[phrase bracket so that periods would  
;;  have segments over them, which, since they never extend, will force a move
;;  to the forest-level at the end of every sentence.
