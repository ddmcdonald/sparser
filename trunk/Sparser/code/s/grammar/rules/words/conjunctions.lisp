;; broken out from "fn words - cases" 12/17/92 v2.3.  Added some 1/11/94
;; added conjunction.] to "and" and "or" 3/17
;; 0.1 (5/12) removed conjunction.] -- solved segmentation problem better.
;;     (9/27) added "instead"
;;     (4/17/10] Added "thus"
;; 0.2 (11/22/12) reorganized the list under a simpler scheme of passing
;;      it through one function and added in a bunch from Comlex (particulary
;;      the multi-word ones). 12/4/12 Removed "only" in favor of its reading
;;      as an approximator. 8/28/14 Added "whereas"
;; 0.3 (8/31/14) Rewriting these as things that make an edge and have form
;;      labels so the new forest sweep can see them. Modeling them sort of
;;      on the way quantifiers are treated.
