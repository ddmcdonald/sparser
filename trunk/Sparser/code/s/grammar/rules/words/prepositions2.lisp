;;;    Module:   "grammar;rules:words:"
;;;   Version:   2.4 June 2014

;; broken out from "fn words - cases" 12/17/92 v2.3
;; 1/11/94 added "through"  7/14 added "up" & "down"  8/19 added "off"
;; 9/1 added "ahead"
;; 0.1 (11/16) restated the definitions in terms of Define-preposition, which
;;      gives their literal edges form categories
;;     (1/6/95) added some locatives  1/9 put in default for brackets
;; 1.0 (1/30) changed all the brackets to be 'treetop', and moved them into
;;      the defaults of the def-form
;; 2.0 (10/14/99) Added the spatial-orientation category for the spatial
;;      prepositions, and broke out the prepositions accordingly.
;;     (11/18) finished debugging it. 
;; 2.1 (11/25) moved all this to [places;object] and [dossiers;spatial prepositions]
;;      because the category depends on location that comes later in the load.
;;      Only the prepositions that don't have a spatial interpretation are left 
;;      here. (for the moment at least) Temporal orienting prepositions are here too
;; 2.2 (1/10/07) List was woefully incomplete compared with [prepositions1]. Took
;;      cases there that were given just as function words and declared them
;;      prepositions. Lets see what happens.
;; 2.3 (4/27/09) Changed the brackets to be specialized for prepositions rather
;;      than the generic 'treetop' brackets. Motivated by verb+preposition facilities.
;;      Copied in missing cases from dossiers/spatial-prepositions
;;     4/17/10 Added "between"
;; 2.4 (9/29/11) Positioned the load to after adjuncts and reworked as a class
;;      creator with special form categories to drive general rules. 10/4 original
;;      base rule was circular so made it have the prep category as its label.
;;     (2/20/12) Added schema to the constructed cfr.  11/25/12 "near", "far"
;;     (1/18/13) Corrected order-of-args in push-onto-plist. 1/30/13 "away".
;;     (5/24/13) "against" (4/30/14) "onto"
;;     (5/29/14) many added from Comlex; added code for synonyms
;;       Noticed some duplications in modifiers. Commented them out with a note.
;;     (6/14/14) put in the brackets global replacing literal list.
