;;;  Version:  0.2 September 2009

;; developed for real from scratch 7/26/94 v2.3.  Added another special
;; case and checks for pronouns 8/19.  9/15 noticed possiblity of
;; getting :multiple-initial-edges
;; 0.1 (10/22) Added a check for a specific rule before going with the
;;      default.
;;     (5/15/95) cleaned up the file
;; 0.2 (9/10/09) Added a generic method/category for generalized possession. 
;;      Might be worth gating.
