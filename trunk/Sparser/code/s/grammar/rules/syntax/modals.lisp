;; moved from [syntax;aux verbs] 5/7/93 v2.3. Populated w/o semantics 1/11/94
;; Given a mix-in interpretation 7/11.  8/2 pulled the check for whether 'modal'
;; was already defined since the change to form-categories makes it moot.
;; 8/16 added "must".  9/6 "won't", "'ll'   9/28 form combination with verb+object
;; 12/30 form combination with infinitive (and verb+ed).  
;; 1/27/95 added modal + verb+passive rules
;; 5/27/96 Disabled subtyping until it's reimplemented. 7/6/07 missed one.
;; 1/30/13 added "might"
;; 5/22/13 Rewrote the whole thing using a uniform set of categories
;;  and generating them for each modal. Incomplete because 
;;   (1) need to implement the case of multiple terms in a rhs
;;   (2) Aux hopping needs to be reformulated and pushed into a schema
;; 1/13/15 Redid be-able-to and conditional. It seems ti be implicated
;;  somehow in the creation of a PSI through some backdoor since lately
;;  they've been turned off.

Have to sort out how to do this. And they need schema anyway.
If we just substitute 'modal' for the previous generated categories
like 'will' then we have form rules with two form rules, which will
blow up. 

They would work find as syntax rules.
They might well work as straight-up cfr rules, and that's a case
 for a one-off ETF for aux-hopping
