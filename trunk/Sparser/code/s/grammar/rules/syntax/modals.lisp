;;;  Version:  January 1995

;; moved from [syntax;aux verbs] 5/7/93 v2.3. Populated w/o semantics 1/11/94
;; Given a mix-in interpretation 7/11.  8/2 pulled the check for whether 'modal'
;; was already defined since the change to form-categories makes it moot.
;; 8/16 added "must".  9/6 "won't", "'ll'   9/28 form combination with verb+object
;; 12/30 form combination with infinitive (and verb+ed).  
;; 1/27/95 added modal + verb+passive rules
;; 5/27/96 Disabled subtyping until it's reimplemented. 7/6/07 missed one.
