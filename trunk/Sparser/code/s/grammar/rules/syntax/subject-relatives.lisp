;;;     File:  "subject relatives"
;;;   Module:  "model;rules:syntax:"
;;;  version:  April 2013

;; initiated 6/18/93 v2.3
;; (8/9/07) Well something else can go in this file, but just now this
;; version of the rule for "who" is winning over the richer on just introduced
;; by WH-word-semantics when the interaction is driven by a form rule that's
;; keyed off of the two edges' pronoun label. 
;; 0.1 (1/1/08) Trying to do it using context to determine whether the
;;  function of a specific prounoun is relative or interogative.
;; 0.2 (4/9/13) Throwing that over in favor of a completion rule

(in-package :sparser)

;;--- One-off treatment for subject relatives. 
;; Needs generalization for other wh terms. They are individuals, so commonalities
;; could be done by method dispatch off their shadows.
