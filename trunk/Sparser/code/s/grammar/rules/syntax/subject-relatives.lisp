;;;     File:  "subject relatives"
;;;   Module:  "grammar;rules:syntax:"
;;;  version:  October 2014

;; initiated 6/18/93 v2.3
;; (8/9/07) Well something else can go in this file, but just now this
;; version of the rule for "who" is winning over the richer on just introduced
;; by WH-word-semantics when the interaction is driven by a form rule that's
;; keyed off of the two edges' pronoun label. 
;; 0.1 (1/1/08) Trying to do it using context to determine whether the
;;  function of a specific prounoun is relative or interogative.
;; 0.2 (4/9/13) Throwing that over in favor of a completion rule
;; 0.3 (7/24/13) Moving in the syntax rules for subject relatives
;;  from rules-over-referents for consolidation.
;;  (9/7/14) Moved out the syntax rules to one place. 9/27/14 started
;;  adding variables and code for generic relationships in the style
;;  that Jerry Hobbs uses. 
;; 4/24/2015 maybe-copy modified head before binding variable -- needed to avoid damaging vocabulary entries
;; 6/2/2015 deal correctly with passives in apply-subject-relative-clause, as in "a protein which is phosphorylated" vs "a protein which phosphorylates"
