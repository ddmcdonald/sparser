;;;  Version:  1.0 August 2014

;; moved over from preterminals code 5/11/93, v2.3
;; 0.1 (3/28/94) changed the 'rule' on these edges from :known-affix to
;;      :spelling-based-edge
;; 0.2 (7/13/94) added more data to the edge
;;     (1/9/95) added Introduce-morph-brackets-from-unknown-word. 1/23 refining
;;      its treatment.
;; 1.0 (7/25/14) Drastic makeover. Droped the DM&P way of introducing new
;;      individuals. Added vastly bigger set of morphological options.
;;      Assigning the brackets to the word rather than introducing them
;;      right now, which simplifies the action by making it just as
;;      though the word had been predefined. Making the words denote categories
;;      using same flag and code as Comlex.
