;;;     File:  "be"
;;;   Module:  "grammar;rules:syntax:"
;;;  Version:  0.2 May 2009

;; redesigned from scratch 5/12/93 v2.3, completed category's realization
;; data 5/27. Added "there's" -> "there is", and negative contractions 1/11/94
;; 7/21 redid the aux-hopping rule in terms of the category 'be' instead of
;; each word individually.  8/1 added neg rule.  8/5 added general calculation
;; for the passive category.
;; 0.1 (8/16) flushed contraction with "it" in favor of pronoun anlysis 
;;      (///of sorts) put in by [???].
;;     (8/19) added contraction with "that".  9/6 " 'm "  11/21 " 're "
;;     5/27/96 Disabled subtyping until it's reimplemented
;; 0.2 (5/10/09) Removed the realization. It's getting in the way of things
;;     like "where are you going" by creating a 'be-something' over "are you"
;;     which is just wrong.
