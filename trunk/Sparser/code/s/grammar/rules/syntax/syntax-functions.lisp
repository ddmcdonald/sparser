;; Initiated 10/27/14 as a place to collect the functions associated
;; with syntactic rules when they have no better home.
;; RJB 12/20/2014 tentative fix to allow interpret-pp-adjunct-to-np 
;; to handle bio-context. 
;; 1/2/2015 put hooks in adjoin-pp-to-vg and interpret-pp-adjunct-to-np to allow for subcategorization frames
;; 1/5/2015 refactor code that David wrote for adjoin-pp-to-vg and interpret-pp-adjunct-to-np to allow them to be used as predicates as well as actions
