;;;     File:  "have"
;;;   Module:  "grammar;rules:syntax:"
;;;  Version:  0.3 September 2013

;; moved from [syntax;aux verbs] 5/7/93 v2.3.  Fleshed out 6/4.
;; Added negative contractions 1/11/94.  7/21 switch aux rule to use
;; category rather than words.  7/29 added explicit bracket assignments
;; 8/1 added neg rule.  9/6 added " 've ".  1/27/95 added do+have
;; 0.1 (4/24) pulled the def. as a main verb in favor of the aux definition
;;      in [words;aux verbs]
;; 0.2 (5/27/96) disabled subtypes for the timebeing
;; 0.3 (5/23/13) Disabled the realization for have. Need to make it
;;      conditional on SDM&P or the like. (9/18/13) Added variant for
;;      have+verb-ed since it can also be verb+passive

 in 'everything' mode because the standard heuristics will
 create constituents without referents. Needs to run in a light
 version of DM&P where we have something valid for the referents.
