;; initiated 5/16/93 v2.3, added form rules 6/6
;; 0.1 (10/13/95) worded out a real analysis and moved in the def form for
;;      a word that's marked as an adverb but not given any semantics.
;; 0.2 (4/24/08) moved the category and def form out to words/adverbs.
;; 1.0 (9/19/11) Flushed the explicit form rule in favor of generated set
;;      by using the tree-family. See words;adverbs1. Put in the generic
;;      method and abstract one using revived modified category.
;; 1.1 (1/18/13) Moved everything else out except for the method
;;      that is used by the adverb tree families. 
;;     (1/12/15) Converted the general method to bind the adverb
;;      to the modified variable on the head rather than drop it
;;      on the floor. 
;; 4/24/2015 maybe-copy modified head before binding variable -- needed to avoid damaging vocabulary entries

 but could be used with adjectives or anything else. The default
 method creates an instance of the modifies casegory to record
 the relationship between the two terms, and then returns the
 head. Specific cases (by the category of the specific adverb)
 could be more ambitious."))
