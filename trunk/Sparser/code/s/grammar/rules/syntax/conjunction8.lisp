;; initated 6/10/93 v2.3, added multiplicity cases 6/15
;; 6.1 (12/13) fixed datatype glitch in resuming from unspaned conj.
;; 6.2 (1/7/94) allowed for trivial multiple-initial-edges
;; 6.3 (1/13) preempting referent calculation if either referent is nil
;;     (10/4) noticed successful referent was being indexed twice
;; 7.0 (12/29) put in check for lists.
;;     (9/13/96) added check for a comma just before the conjunction.
;;     (2/12/07) Added quiescence interaction checks in the two routines
;;      that create edges. 2/13 Got the conjoined edge to pass back up
;;      to the routine that decides what to do next, fixing bug with the
;;      treetop level. 8/11 modified the mark routine to lower the flag
;;      if it's already up and we're in speech mode. 
;;     (8/3/11) Added "or" as exact copy of the hook on "and". 8/4 Added
;;      a treetop hook for the case when we don't have adjacent segments.
;; 7.1 (10/18/11) Writing the look-under scheme.  11/8/12 Replaced format
;;      call with trace. Trapped case where edge-after is a word in situation
;;      in Boeing where two quotations are adjacent but the second  hasn't
;;      finished. 11/25/12 fixed fanout when "and" is covered with an edge
;;      and patched over another "won't do that yet" case.
;;     (3/6/13) Adapted multiple-initial-edge case in check-out-possible-conjunction
;; 8.1 (8/27/14) Completely reworked the continuation criteria to use
;;      the scan-another-segment? abstraction rather than burn in the usual
;;      case by hand.
;; 8.2 (8/31/14) Now that there's an edge over a conjunction for the benefit
;;      of the new forest protocol, there's a bug (of sort) in the scanner
;;      that keeps the words from being passed to complete/hugin so added
;;      equivalents based on the edge label
;; 8.3 (9/22/14) added heuristic based on identical form, with the flag
;;      *allow-form-conjunction-heuristic* to govern when its used. It's
;;      off by default and dynamically bound when wanted. 
;;     (10/6/14) Fanout from successive-scans to guard against unhandled
;;      *pending-conjunction* flag in the completion routine. 
;; 8.4 (11/17/14) Revised that to have them push onto the flag symbol.
;;   1/15/2015 allow verb+ed and adjective to combine in early phase
;; 8.5 (3/13/15) repealed the restriction on combining S's. If it gets
;;   into trouble semantically we can add more specific checks.
;; 4/27/2015 tighten up conjunction of items with the same form -- put in some tests on semantics
;;  using method conjunction-incompatible-labels
;; 4/28/2015 Added bunch of variables and switches to collect information on conjunctions
;; 5/30/15 Cleaned up that code so that I could read it.
;; 7/24/15 Permitting a collection of categories in multi-element conjunction
;; 7/26/2015 allow conjunctions of bio-entities and proteins, using method bio-coercion-compatible? 
;; and print out the fact that the bio-entities so-conjoined are likely to be unrecognized proteins.
