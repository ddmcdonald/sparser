;;--- Haphazard treatment of WH questions
;; In a treatment that wasn't haphazard we'd keep track of
;; the gaps in the clauses and use the traces or their
;; equivalent. Also needs the non-question usage and 
;; more systematic way to notice and sweep up the 'question'
;; aspects so that polar question fall out from the same
;; inversion of subject and verb.
