;;;  Version:  2.23 July 2014

;; 1.1 (2/6/92 v2.2) changed the allowed values for unknown-words
;;     (2/7) Added *switch-setting* and *track-salient-objects*
;; 2.0 (9/2 v2.3) renamed the top-edges chart protocol
;; 2.1 (11/28) started fleshing out options for BBN and checking that everything
;;      is spelled out
;; 2.2 (2/26/93) flushed a reference to *version-of-assess-position* and
;;      *edge-protocol*
;; 2.3 (4/6/93) added *edge-vector-type*, 4/7 tweeked the wording of Switch-settings
;;     (4/9) added newline interpretations, 4/20 refined next-terminal choices
;; 2.4 (5/11) added Debris-analysis-setting
;; 2.5 (6/30) added call to grammar-switch-settings in Switch-settings
;;     (7/8) added *do-debris-analysis*
;; 2.6 (8/2) moved edges over morph to DA rather than toplevel
;; 2.7 (9/14) tweeked a value for toplevel-only
;; 2.8 (12/13) added dispatch-off-capitalization-data, changed top-only to use trivial
;;      newline fsa.
;; 2.9 (3/15/94) adjusted top-level to allow duplication of dotted-rules
;; 2.10 (4/24) adjusted it to separate parsing strategy from use of heuristics
;;      (4/26) tweeked that a bit.
;; 2.11 (7/11) added DM&P setting
;; 2.12 (7/22) adjusted settings so top-edges-setting/ddm would negate stronger ones
;; 2.13 (7/25) added flags for ..-affixes
;; 2.14 (9/28) added flags for forest level and capitalization protocol
;;      (10/19) extended that
;; 2.15 (1/5/95) added *current-analysis-mode* and its handler.  1/9 added flag
;;       for introducing brackets from unknown words.
;;      (2/14) changed default to *current-analysis-mode* so Preferences menu
;;       would come up in :no-dm&p
;;      (2/27) added *count-input-lines*
;; 2.16 (3/13) changed Top-edges to also do word morphology
;;      (3/31) added Turnoff-standard-extras
;;      (5/7) added *do-debris-analysis* to Standard-extras
;;      (5/26) tweeked Update-analysis-mode
;; 2.17 (9/6) tweeked Update-analysis-mode again
;;      (10/25) changed name of the dotted-rule dup. flag
;; 2.18 (8/17/97) Remodularized to pull together the common parts between all-edges
;;       and top-edges. Started a top-edges variant for bbn.
;;      (6/22/07) Added setting for Answer. (10/2) added fire-setting and
;;       ambush-setting and modified top-edges-setting/ddm to turn them off.
;;      (4/09) added checkpoint-ops-setting. (8/31/09) added poirot-interface-setting.
;;      (10/8) Added listing of per-run-init-forms to switch-settings.
;;      (2/20/10) Added just-bracketing-setting after fixing the word-frequency-setting.
;;      2/22 pulled *version-of-capitalization-dispatch* back in for just-bracketing
;;      because it's exposed when not doing PNF. 
;; 2.19 (3/12/10) Extended just-bracketing-setting to introduce brackets and edges
;;      from unknown words. Turns them off in top-edges-setting/ddm. (4/20/10) Fixed
;;      some spill over into word-frequency-setting where nothing heuristic should
;;      run. (2/20/11) Folded *make-edges-over-new-digit-sequences* into standard ddm
;;      settings. 
;;      (10/30/12) Setting up for Grok. 1/21/13 Turned on *do-strong-domain-modeling* in it
;; 2.20 (4/30/13) Converted Grok experiments into tuned-grok seeing
;;      (7/17/13) added strider-setting. (8/19/13) Added display setting and other odd
;;       things to it to esure they took effect. (9/16/13) stubbed c3-setting
;;      (9/18/13) Changed grok to enable all the after-segment options. Rely on
;;       the passes to tune them. 10/2/13 Integrated sentence handling into Strider
;; 2.21 (10/21/13) Moved the old contents of fire into Grok and then made grok the
;;       equivalent of Strider so we can use that going forward as the default
;;       that operations are built on.
;; 2.22 (1/22/14) Added (turn-off-c3) to all the bigger sets. 1/29/14 refined 
;;       fire-setting so we cover the segments. 3/3/14 added bio-setting. 
;;       3/18/14 tweak to the c3 setting. 5/7/14 Completion actions were still
;;       running in just-bracketing setting. 5/19/14 Tuned bio-setting.
;; 2.23 (7/24/14) Converted direct setting of *forest-level-protocol* to 
;;       calling what-to-do-at-the-forest-level
