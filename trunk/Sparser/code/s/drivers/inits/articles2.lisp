;; 1.1  (3/28/91 v1.8.1)  Added Clear-individuals, and improved the
;;      conditionalization according to the load-time switches
;; 1.2  (7/11 v1.8.5)  Added Clear-traversal-state and merged the two
;;      when's on *model* into one if.
;; 1.3  (10/8 v2.0)  Removed the possibility that *model* could be Nil
;; 1.4  (11/12 v2.0.1)  Put back in the equivalent -- a check that the
;;      grammar has been loaded ///needs some flags as well.
;; 1.5  (5/9/92 v2.2) Added clearing the stack of pending left openers
;; 1.6  (6/19) Added initializing the context variables
;; 1.7  (7/14 v2.3) Switched fromm anaphor table to Discourse-history
;; 1.8  (9/2) commented out the salient-objects, since that code isn't
;;        being loaded at this point with the new category stuff
;; 2.9  (12/28) pulled a reference to the old indexing scheme for names
;; 2.10 (11/12/93) added clearing the display window
;; 2.11 (12/8) switched to a generic routine for initializing sections.
;; 2.12 (12/15) introduced a mechanism for open-ended initializations
;; 2.13 (5/2/94) tweeked routine so that those initializations would be
;;       seen even if the grammar flag was down (e.g. for bbn)
;; 2.14 (8/8) reordered Reap-individuals and Initialize-discourse-history
;;      (5/13/95) promulgated a fn renaming.
;;      (1/9/96) added check for an interrupted embedded scan.
;; 2.15 (7/23/09) Added clear-debug.
;; 2.16 (2/11/13) Broke out the 'real' per article initializatin so it
;;       can be called by itself. (2/18/13) broke out the individual and 
;;       history cleaner for the same reason. Gating that on the global
;;       bound in do-document-as-stream-of-files. 
;; 2.17 (3/14/13) Added section initialization and article creation,
