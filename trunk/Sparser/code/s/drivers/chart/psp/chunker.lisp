;; Initiated 10/8/14
;; ddm: 10/16/14 Rewrote identify-chunks. Commented out lines anticipating 
;; words not covered by edges. Added traces.
;; RJB 12/13/2014 changes to method "remaining-forms" and to code in categories.lisp
;; to provide more subtle handling of NP chunking to deal with verb+ed cases
;; contrast "direct binding to activated forms of RAS" where "activated" is likely to be a pre-nominal modifier (from j2)
;; with "these drugs blocked ERK activity" where "blocked" is the main verb.
;; the key is to end a NG when you hit a verb+ed immediately preceded by a noun, and to prevent that verb+ed from
;; starting another NG (so that it becomes a VG on its own)
