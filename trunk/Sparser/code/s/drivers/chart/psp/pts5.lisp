;;;  Version:  5.14 July 2013

;; initiated 4/22/91, extended 4/23, tweeked 4/24,26
;; 5/6, "march/seg" saves version that doesn't check for an extensible
;;      rightmost edge.
;; (8/8 v1.9) Patched end-of-segment-measurements into Segment-parsed1
;; 4.0 (10/14/92 v2.3) started adding traces
;; 5.0 (4/25/93) made adaptions to fit the new word-level scanning protocol
;;     (5/7) tweeking
;;     (6/2) Segment-coverage hadn't anticipated multiple edges at the
;;      right end.
;;     (6/13) reorganized the Segment-finished dispatch into subroutines
;; 5.1 (6/16) tweeked def. of no-edges case to fix pointer following problem
;;      in call from Check-for-segment-start
;; 5.2 (3/4/94) moved defpram. *use-Segment-edges-as-segment-defaults* to [flags]
;; 5.3 (3/28) moved out the definition of the category 'segment', added the
;;      hook for DM&P
;;     (4/1) wrote a version of spanned-segment that removed dotted edges, but
;;      it didn't solve the problem with "chief executive", and also the code
;;      for segment-coverage didn't react to the change, so commented it out
;; 5.4 (4/24) guarded calls to heuristics with *do-heuristic-segment-analysis* flag
;; 5.5 (5/6) got more systematic about noting the end of the segment
;; 5.6 (5/12) added network-flow traces
;; 5.7 (5/25) added flag to track edge-induced segment boundaries vs. regular
;;     (7/11) added a variable to No-further-action-on-segment
;; 5.8 (7/26) put in a subr. for the return from :null-span
;; 5.9 (1/5/95) reordered finish op and creation of def. of default segment
;; 5.10 (2/13) broke Segment-coverage into two parts to provide another entry point
;;      (2/15) patched Coverage-over-region to handle one-word case of the right edge
;;       overshooting the left boundary of the segment
;;      (2/22) fixed a bug in the patch
;; 5.10 (4/12) hacked sf-action/some-adjacent-edges to apply heuristics
;;      (4/20) started to deal w/  "[ has ][ awarded ..." problem
;; 5.11 (5/18) found a case after parsing that didn't look for the conj flag
;; 5.12 (3/13/96) adjusted sf-action/all-contiguous-edges to try HA
;; 5.13 (2/9/07) incorporated hook to strong domain modeling. (2/23) fixed a
;;       massive bug in Loop-through-segment-for-some-edges.
;;      (5/28/12) Added inline segment printer option. 10/10 tweaked it.
;;      (1/21/13) Commented out the possibility of using old dm&p and broke out
;;       the usual set of options out of segment finished.  2/6/13 put in trap
;;       for the threading bug where the right segment boundary global is nil
;;       so we get a more intelligible error message. 
;; 5.14 (2/28/13) Abstracted the after-parsing protocol choice.
;;      (7/1/13) Moved in the reify implicit individuals options. 
;;      (7/29/13) Added check-segment-finished-hook in the main line but just
;;       as a one-off to convert some titles to people. Rearranged the code
;;       a bit for better reading.
