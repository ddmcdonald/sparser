;; initiated 4/23/93 v2.3
;; putting in fsas 5/7
;; 0.1 (5/15) added call to caps-fsa before other word-fsas
;;     (5/21) tweeked state in Figure-out-what-to-do...
;; 0.2 (6/14) added Scan-next-segment as initializing common resumption
;;      point for the higher processes
;; 0.3 (6/30) moved code from Check-for-]-on-position to the adjudication routine
;;      it calls.
;; 0.4 (9/14) added edge-fsas and a trace
;; 0.5 (12/10) moved the point where PNF is called to within word-actions
;; 0.6 (12/17) moved it back after interaction between PNF demands and
;;      section-marker demands was appreciated. (12/22) fixed a detail in that.
;;     (1/5/94) tweeking another detail involving full articles and paragraphs
;; 0.7 (4/23) added :preterminals-installed to Figure-out...
;; 1.0 (5/5) added a final step in the fsa because some .[ were being ignored
;;      and subdivided the status data more throughly to help w/ distinctions
;; 1.1 (5/12) hacked Scan-next-segment to appreciate prescanned segments
