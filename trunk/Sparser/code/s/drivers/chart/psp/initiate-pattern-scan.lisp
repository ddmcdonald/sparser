;; initiated 9/21/95.  Added temporary guard against edges ending at the
;; starting positin 10/18. 
;; 0.1 (7/11/96) fixed what looked like a bug and cleaned up the threading
;; 0.2 (3/1/07) Added a hack that preempts specific pattern rule checks
;;     in favor of one that operates across the board.
