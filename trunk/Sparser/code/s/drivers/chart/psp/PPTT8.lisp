;;;    Module:   "drivers:chart:psp:"
;;;   Version:   8.4 February 2007

;; 7.0 (5/11/92 v2.3) bumped the version to accomodate the changes to
;;      the scan routine
;; 7.1 (6/15) reviewed/tweeked the threading. 6/16 ditto
;;     (5/6/94) added network-flow trace
;; 7.2 (5/7) gave find-rightmost-edge an optional arg. for its end pos
;; 8.0 (7/13/94) Modified what it meant to 'start at the quiescent position' to be
;;      the position at the end of the just-scanned segment rather than its beginning.
;;      If this isn't done then some combinations aren't parsed.
;; 8.1 (9/28) introduced parameterization of the operation set
;; 8.2 (10/26) added provision for a DA pass.  10/31 fixed bug with edge and
;;      management of quiescence ptr.
;; 8.3 (1/16/95) tracking down an infinite loop by looking at more reasons to
;;      go immediately back to the segment level.
;; 8.4 (2/14/07) Fixed a bug with the interactions from conjunctions that
;;      overspan both TT boundaries then call parse-forest-and-do-treetops.
;;      (3/7) Trying to fix infinite loop in parse-between-boundaries
