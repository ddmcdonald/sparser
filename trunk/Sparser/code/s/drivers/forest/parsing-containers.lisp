;;;   Module:  "drivers;forest:"
;;;  Version:  May 2015

;; Initiated 8/6/14 to hold the new class of containers to support
;; analysis and discourse structure to go with the new forest protocol
;; Extended with new cases through 9/26/14. 10/6/14 Added methods to
;; query and set parsing status. 
;; 1/28/15 adding more mixins. 2/3/15 added pronouns to layout
;; 5/12/15 moved most classes and methods to content-methods.lisp
;; so they're all in one place. Leaving just the sentence-layout that
;; was what started this file.

;;--------- This is nominally a mixin, but
;;  the fact that we use it to keep track of things -during-
;;  the parse makes it less what we want to presevere 
;;  in the document structure, particularly since it stores edges.
;;  Long-term storage of this information will be in the text
;;  structure
