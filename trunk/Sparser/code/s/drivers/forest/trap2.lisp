;;;  Version:  2.7 January 1996

;; 2.0 (4/29/91 v1.8.4) bumped the version to 2 and started bringing it
;;      around to the new scheme.
;; 2.1 (10/31 v2.0) Pulled the old provision for the edge not really
;;      being a treetop and replaced it with a break
;; 2.2 (11/25 v2.0) put in test against *do-general-actions-on-treetops*
;;      so they wouldn't be done accidentally.
;; 2.3 (7/16/93 v2.3) cleaned things up a bit.
;; 2.4 (8/7/94) passing through a position argument. 9/27 flushed redundant trace
;; 2.5 (1/16/95) added an escape path for case of edge not being a treetop
;; 2.6 (5/11) put the break under gate of *debug-treetops*
;; 2.7 (11/9) put in a hack check for the case where the edge that the tt is
;;      used-in is a quotation, in which case we ignore the error msg because\
;;      it really deserves a better treatment.  (12/29) added angle-brackets
;;      (12/31) added conjunctions. (1/1/96) added the rest of the established
;;      'paired-punctuation' cases.
