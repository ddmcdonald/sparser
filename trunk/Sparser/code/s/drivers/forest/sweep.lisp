;; Initiated 8/30/14. To hold the new class of containers to support
;; analysis and discourse structure to go with the new forest protocol
;; RJB 12/14/2014 simple (hack) fix to allow pronouns in simple subject verb construction moified categories in sweep-sentence-treetops
;; add parameter *no-error-on-no-form*, set to nil when you want to see which edges have no forms during sweep,
;; This is a work-around for the problems with defining MEK and MAPK...
