TX           There's just no pleasing some people; ask Eastern
          Airlines.
             Its promotion promising 100% refunds to dissatisfied
          full-fare passengers has spawned some creative complaining.
             Take, for instance, one passenger's displeasure with the
          texture of his morning croissant, or the gripe another had
          that his ice cream was too soft. Or the angst of a third: "I
          felt ignored." All three traumas netted refunds.
             The carrier started offering the no-questions-asked
          guarantee to woo back business travelers who abandoned
          Eastern in droves because of a bruising strike and highly
          public bankruptcy-court proceedings. The guarantee applies
          only to unrestricted, undiscounted tickets -- the kind bought
          most often by business people.
             The program had been set to expire last month, but Eastern
          extended it through Sept. 30. That means the carrier will
          probably be getting more complaints like these that have come
          in written requests for refunds: "I don't like pizza in first
          class," and "The flight attendant didn't offer to take my
          coat until I mentioned it." Eastern gave those passengers
          their money back, too.
             As of the original June 30 cutoff, Eastern had refunded
          $43,425 to 126 people, most of whom registered the kinds of
          complaints that usually inspire letters to airlines -- lost
          luggage, late arrivals and the like. But an Atlanta passenger
          wanted her money back because her only newspaper choice was
          The Wall Street Journal. "We didn't turn down any requests,"
          says a spokesman.
             Eastern counts the promotion as a huge success. "When you
          think in terms of the traffic the offer may have generated,"
          the refunds were worth it, the spokesman says. While he isn't
          specific about how much business the guarantee brought in, he
          does say Eastern has flown tens of thousands of passengers
          since the program began May 7, but not all were full-fare
          fliers.
             Airlines often mimic promotions started by competitors;
          this one, however, isn't exactly spreading like wildfire. Pan
          Am guaranteed its first-class service for a while on select
          flights earlier this year. And the Trump Shuttle gave out
          department-store gift certificates to passengers whose
          flights didn't arrive on time, but stopped after
          air-traffic-control problems and bad weather made too many
          flights tardy. Now it gives frequent-flier miles.

             Liquidation Sought
             By 3 Bondholders

TX           HOUSTON -- General Homes Corp. said three bondholders
          filed a petition with a Houston court to force the company
          into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.
             The home builder, which stopped making interest payments
          on its 12% subordinated notes due in 1998 2 1/2 years ago,
          said the bondholders are seeking to force the company to
          liquidate.
             Among the bondholders filing the petition in the Houston
          federal Bankruptcy Court is veteran investor Stanford Phelps
          of S.N. Phelps & Co., a Greenwich, Conn., bond broker. In a
          similar move last year, Mr. Phelps forced MCorp, a
        Dallas-based bank holding company, into seeking the
          protection of the court after he purchased $2 million of
          MCorp's distressed debt at a hefty discount and threatened
          the banking concern with an involuntary petition.
             In the General Homes petition, Mr. Phelps demanded that he
          and a business associate be placed on the company's board. "I
          don't think those boys know how to turn the company around,"
          Mr. Phelps said, referring to General Homes' current
          management team. "We're just trying to fix their mess."
             For more than two years, General Homes has been trying to
          restructure about $250 million in senior debt and $140
          million in subordinated debt. Offers to exchange two issues
          of subordinated notes for convertible preferred stock failed
          this spring. Since then, the company said it has been
          negotiating with its lenders, including Citibank, to avoid
          filing for protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws.
             W.A. Le Sage, General Homes president, said the company
          plans to pursue an out-of-court settlement. "It is my
          understanding that senior bank lenders and shareholders
          prefer to work this out outside bankruptcy courts," he said.
             Analysts say that a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing would be
          costly and could scare off both customers and suppliers, a
          move that could "wipe out the company," said analyst Kevin J.
          McCabe of R.D. Smith & Co. Under Chapter 11, the company
          continues to operate under court protection while it devises
          a plan to repay creditors.
             But Mr. Phelps isn't likely to go away quietly. "Stan
          Phelps is very rigid," said analyst Kenneth Campbell of
          Montvale, N.J.-based Audit Investments Inc. "His style is
          simple: Buy cheap bonds and rattle the cage of management
          until he makes a good profit. They either buy him out to shut
          him up or put him on the board."
             Mr. Le Sage, meantime, insisted that the company wouldn't
          give in to Mr. Phelps's demands. "This guy swoops into town
          and threatens our company with all sorts of demands and
          threatens to throw us in the can," Mr. Le Sage said. "We told
          him our people don't react well to blackmail."
