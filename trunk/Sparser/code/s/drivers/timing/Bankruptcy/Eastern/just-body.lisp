   There's just no pleasing some people; ask Eastern
Airlines.
   Its promotion promising 100% refunds to dissatisfied
full-fare passengers has spawned some creative complaining.
   Take, for instance, one passenger's displeasure with the
texture of his morning croissant, or the gripe another had
that his ice cream was too soft. Or the angst of a third: "I
felt ignored." All three traumas netted refunds.
   The carrier started offering the no-questions-asked
guarantee to woo back business travelers who abandoned
Eastern in droves because of a bruising strike and highly
public bankruptcy-court proceedings. The guarantee applies
only to unrestricted, undiscounted tickets -- the kind bought
most often by business people.
   The program had been set to expire last month, but Eastern
extended it through Sept. 30. That means the carrier will
probably be getting more complaints like these that have come
in written requests for refunds: "I don't like pizza in first
class," and "The flight attendant didn't offer to take my
coat until I mentioned it." Eastern gave those passengers
their money back, too.
   As of the original June 30 cutoff, Eastern had refunded
$43,425 to 126 people, most of whom registered the kinds of
complaints that usually inspire letters to airlines -- lost
luggage, late arrivals and the like. But an Atlanta passenger
wanted her money back because her only newspaper choice was
The Wall Street Journal. "We didn't turn down any requests,"
says a spokesman.
   Eastern counts the promotion as a huge success. "When you
think in terms of the traffic the offer may have generated,"
the refunds were worth it, the spokesman says. While he isn't
specific about how much business the guarantee brought in, he
does say Eastern has flown tens of thousands of passengers
since the program began May 7, but not all were full-fare
fliers.
   Airlines often mimic promotions started by competitors;
this one, however, isn't exactly spreading like wildfire. Pan
Am guaranteed its first-class service for a while on select
flights earlier this year. And the Trump Shuttle gave out
department-store gift certificates to passengers whose
flights didn't arrive on time, but stopped after
air-traffic-control problems and bad weather made too many
flights tardy. Now it gives frequent-flier miles.
