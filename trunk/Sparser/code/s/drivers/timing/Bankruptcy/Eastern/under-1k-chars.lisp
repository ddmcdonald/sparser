   There's just no pleasing some people; ask Eastern
Airlines.
   Its promotion promising 100% refunds to dissatisfied
full-fare passengers has spawned some creative complaining.
   Take, for instance, one passenger's displeasure with the
texture of his morning croissant, or the gripe another had
that his ice cream was too soft. Or the angst of a third: \"I
felt ignored.\" All three traumas netted refunds.
