TX           There's just no pleasing some people; ask Eastern
          Airlines.
             Its promotion promising 100% refunds to dissatisfied
          full-fare passengers has spawned some creative complaining.
             Take, for instance, one passenger's displeasure with the
          texture of his morning croissant, or the gripe another had
          that his ice cream was too soft. Or the angst of a third: "I
          felt ignored." All three traumas netted refunds.
             The carrier started offering the no-questions-asked
          guarantee to woo back business travelers who abandoned
          Eastern in droves because of a bruising strike and highly
          public bankruptcy-court proceedings. The guarantee applies
          only to unrestricted, undiscounted tickets -- the kind bought
          most often by business people.
             The program had been set to expire last month, but Eastern
          extended it through Sept. 30. That means the carrier will
          probably be getting more complaints like these that have come
          in written requests for refunds: "I don't like pizza in first
          class," and "The flight attendant didn't offer to take my
          coat until I mentioned it." Eastern gave those passengers
          their money back, too.
             As of the original June 30 cutoff, Eastern had refunded
          $43,425 to 126 people, most of whom registered the kinds of
          complaints that usually inspire letters to airlines -- lost
          luggage, late arrivals and the like. But an Atlanta passenger
          wanted her money back because her only newspaper choice was
          The Wall Street Journal. "We didn't turn down any requests,"
          says a spokesman.
             Eastern counts the promotion as a huge success. "When you
          think in terms of the traffic the offer may have generated,"
          the refunds were worth it, the spokesman says. While he isn't
          specific about how much business the guarantee brought in, he
          does say Eastern has flown tens of thousands of passengers
          since the program began May 7, but not all were full-fare
          fliers.
             Airlines often mimic promotions started by competitors;
          this one, however, isn't exactly spreading like wildfire. Pan
          Am guaranteed its first-class service for a while on select
          flights earlier this year. And the Trump Shuttle gave out
          department-store gift certificates to passengers whose
          flights didn't arrive on time, but stopped after
          air-traffic-control problems and bad weather made too many
          flights tardy. Now it gives frequent-flier miles.

             Liquidation Sought

TX           HOUSTON -- General Homes Corp. said three bondholders
          filed a petition with a Houston court to force the company
          into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.
             The home builder, which stopped making interest payments
          on its 12% subordinated notes due in 1998 2 1/2 years ago,
          said the bondholders are seeking to force the company to
          liquidate.
             Among the bondholders filing the petition in the Houston
          federal Bankruptcy Court is veteran investor Stanford Phelps
          of S.N. Phelps & Co., a Greenwich, Conn., bond broker. In a
          similar move last year, Mr. Phelps forced MCorp, a
        Dallas-based bank holding company, into seeking the
          protection of the court after he purchased $2 million of
          MCorp's distressed debt at a hefty discount and threatened
          the banking concern with an involuntary petition.
             In the General Homes petition, Mr. Phelps demanded that he
          and a business associate be placed on the company's board. "I
          don't think those boys know how to turn the company around,"
          Mr. Phelps said, referring to General Homes' current
          management team. "We're just trying to fix their mess."
             For more than two years, General Homes has been trying to
          restructure about $250 million in senior debt and $140
          million in subordinated debt. Offers to exchange two issues
          of subordinated notes for convertible preferred stock failed
          this spring. Since then, the company said it has been
          negotiating with its lenders, including Citibank, to avoid
          filing for protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws.
             W.A. Le Sage, General Homes president, said the company
          plans to pursue an out-of-court settlement. "It is my
          understanding that senior bank lenders and shareholders
          prefer to work this out outside bankruptcy courts," he said.
             Analysts say that a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing would be
          costly and could scare off both customers and suppliers, a
          move that could "wipe out the company," said analyst Kevin J.
          McCabe of R.D. Smith & Co. Under Chapter 11, the company
          continues to operate under court protection while it devises
          a plan to repay creditors.
             But Mr. Phelps isn't likely to go away quietly. "Stan
          Phelps is very rigid," said analyst Kenneth Campbell of
          Montvale, N.J.-based Audit Investments Inc. "His style is
          simple: Buy cheap bonds and rattle the cage of management
          until he makes a good profit. They either buy him out to shut
          him up or put him on the board."
             Mr. Le Sage, meantime, insisted that the company wouldn't
          give in to Mr. Phelps's demands. "This guy swoops into town
          and threatens our company with all sorts of demands and
          threatens to throw us in the can," Mr. Le Sage said. "We told
          him our people don't react well to blackmail."

GV        SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
TX           DALLAS -- Southmark Corp. should sue its former auditing
          firm, Grant Thornton, for negligence, and its former top
          officers, Gene E. Phillips and William Friedman, for
          mismanagement, a court-appointed examiner recommended in his
          final report to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
             Characterizing his 500-page report as "a story . . . of
          unsound acquisitions, overvalued assets, illusory sales,
          phantom profits, hidden liabilities, insider dealing and
          outsider cronyism," examiner Neal Batson also recommended
          that the company further investigate the roles of Arthur
          Weiss, current chairman, and certain directors in the
          collapse of the real-estate conglomerate.
             Southmark expanded aggressively as a full service
          real-estate broker, management firm, syndicator and lender
          until the market for real estate limited partnerships
          collapsed in 1987. In obvious distress by 1988, the company
          ousted Messrs. Phillips and Friedman in January 1989, and
          filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection six months later.
          Southmark attorneys don't believe Mr. Batson's report will
          affect the confirmation of the company's plan of
          reorganization, expected tomorrow.
             In a prepared statement, Grant Thornton "emphatically
          disagreed" with Mr. Batson's report. The accounting firm
          asserted that "Southmark didn't fail because of its auditor.
          Grant will not allow itself to be made a scapegoat."
             An attorney for Mr. Friedman, Southmark's former vice
          chairman, called the charges against his client unfounded.
          Mr. Phillips, the company's former chairman, andUrrent
          Southmark officials couldn't be reached for comment.
             Mr. Batson, who concluded that Southmark was insolvent by
          late 1987 despite the apparent health of its financial
          statements, identified $750 million in subsequent
          transactions that could be challenged as preferential or
          fraudulent transfers of assets.
             Among the instances of "outsider cronyism" he cited was a
          $2.2 million payment in 1988 to entities partially controlled
          by Edwin T. McBirney III, the flamboyant former thrift
          executive who was indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury
          in Dallas in an unrelated case. The potential claims, the
          examiner notes, represent "a significant opportunity" to
          increase the payout to Southmark's creditors.
             In hearings to confirm a plan of reorganization, Southmark
          attorneys showed little enthusiasm for pursuing the largest
          of those potential claims -- $481 million transferred by
          Southmark to its wholly owned San Jacinto Savings Association
          at the demand of thrift regulators.
             Pursuing claims against the thrift, said R. Paul Wickes,
          an attorney for Southmark, could lead to seizure of San
          Jacinto by the Office of Thrift Supervision and "litigation
          that never ends."
             Southmark hopes to rebuild around its Houston-based
          thrift. Its reorganization plan, which has been approved by
          unsecured creditors and preferred shareholders, contemplates
          a contribution of $100 million in capital to the thrift and
          an orderly sale of its remaining assets. While the Office of
          Thrift Supervision has agreed to the plan, it hasn't offered
          any assurances that it won't seize the thrift subsequently.
          As of March 31, San Jacinto had a negative net worth of $50.8
          million.
             Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission
          challenged clauses in the reorganization plan that would
          shield current Southmark management from lawsuits. "The SEC
          is raising it as an issue of legal significance to investors
          generally" and to the regulators, said Gordon Robinson, an
          SEC staff attorney.

          1.44 billion revenue passenger miles from the 252.47 million
          a year earlier when a strike cut flights.
             A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one
          mile. The carrier said load factor for the month was down to
          61.41% from 61.95% a year earlier.
             In the first six months, Eastern said it flew 9.08 billion

          was 61.59%, up from 58.46%.
             Eastern, formerly a unit of Texas Air Corp., is being

          life insurance group of Lomas Financial Corp., a Dallas-based
          mortgage banking concern, in a transaction valued at $165
          million.
             Conseco, an insurance holding company, said it will
          acquire the group through Conseco Capital Partners Limited
          Partnership, which it created with institutional investors to
          acquire and operate life insurance companies.
             The company will pay $140 million in cash and $25 million
          in junior pay-in-kind securities for the group, which
          consists of three insurance companies in Indianapolis, Little
          Rock, Ark., and Salt Lake city. As of March 31, the group had
          total assets of $860 million.
             The proposed purchase would be the second acquisition made
          through Conseco Capital Partners. Late last month, the
          partnership acquired Great American Reserve Insurance Co.
          from Temple-Inland Inc., Diboll, Texas, for $143.5 million.
             Conseco said the planned transaction is subject to
          approval by the bankruptcy court that has jurisdiction over
          Lomas's proceedings under Chapter 11 of the federal
          Bankruptcy Code, which protects the company from creditors'
          lawsuits while it forms a plan to repay debts, and by various
          states' insurance regulatory agencies. The deal is expected
          to be completed by this autumn.

TX           NEW YORK -- Saul S. Cohen, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
          Inc.'s former top internal cop and one of Wall Street's
          best-paid lawyers, bolted the securities business to rejoin
          his former law firm.
             But don't expect Mr. Cohen to apologize for the $2
          million-a-year salary package he worked out at Drexel in
          April 1989 -- a deal that spun heads even on Wall Street. He
          now bills clients a fat $450 an hour at Rosenman & Colin, a
          New York law firm he rejoined after a one-year hiatus.
             "You're not taken seriously {among investment bankers}
          unless you make lots of money," says Mr. Cohen. "I was the
          most expensive . . . general counsel in the universe, and
          they knew it," he adds. "It conveyed authority."
             Mr. Cohen was brought in as Drexel's general counsel last
          year to help the firm comply with its settlement with the
          Securities and Exchange Commission. Drexel pleaded guilty to
          six felonies and agreed last year to pay $650 million in
          fines and penalties.
             Much of Mr. Cohen's Drexel stash, however, is tied up in
          court: Drexel, which filed for bankruptcy-law protection in
          February, still owes him $5.25 million of a four-year, $8
          million package, Mr. Cohen says.
             At Drexel, the brash Mr. Cohen was known as a hard
          bargainer in Drexel's settlements with state regulators to
          keep the firm open for business. Before Drexel's collapse,
          Mr. Cohen negotiated settlements with 43 states totaling
          about $8 million. His duties at Drexel included compliance
          control and reorganizing the firm's legal department.
             His biggest challenge: Addressing the lax compliance tone
          at Drexel. "If there's one place where they failed, that's
          it," he says.
             Drexel wasn't his first big challenge. For several years,
          Mr. Cohen has been the court-appointed trustee for Bevill,
          Bresler & Schulman Inc., a broker-dealer that filed for
          bankruptcy-law proceedings.
             The 53-year-old Mr. Cohen originally joined Rosenman &
          Colin from Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc., where he had been
          general counsel. He also had been general counsel at A.G.
          Edwards & Sons and is former president of the Securities
          Industry Association's legal and compliance division.
             Back at Rosenman & Colin, Mr. Cohen will focus on
          securities litigation and compliance. The firm's brokerage
          clients include, among others, Bear Stearns Cos., Donaldson
          Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.,

TX           Federal mediators overseeing contract talks between
          Eastern Airlines and its pilots union declared an impasse,
          setting off a 30-day countdown toward a strike or a
          settlement.
             The union, the Air Line Pilots Association, immediately
          said it would send strike ballots to its members.
             It's unlikely, however, that a strike would have anywhere
          near the impact of last year's strike by machinists, which
          was supported by pilots and flight attendants. That strike,
          in March 1989, nearly grounded Eastern and tipped the
          financially ailing carrier into bankruptcy court. Eastern
          painstakingly built itself back to about 80% of its
          pre-strike operations, and the pilots and flight attendants
          ended their walkouts in November.
             The makeup of the pilot work force is starkly different
          this time. The 1,900 pilots now flying for Eastern -- about
          half of the pre-strike total -- are evenly split between
          recently hired replacements and pilots who crossed the picket
          line. Neither group has any reason to show special loyalty to
          the pilots union. Only 89 pilots who went out on strike
          before have been recalled. Union officials estimate that an
          additional 1,403 are waiting to return. Under labor law,
          however, the pilots union is still the bargaining agent for
          all pilots working for Eastern.
             "The so-called strike vote they're talking about would be
          polling pilots who aren't working," said an Eastern
          spokeswoman. "It would be a non-event."
             The union's contract expired in mid-1988, but under
          airline labor law, the old contract remains in effect until a
          new one is negotiated or the National Mediation Board finds
          the two sides are at an impasse. That happened when the board
          proferred arbitration to the two sides, and the union
          accepted while Eastern refused.
             The issues that brought this confrontation to a head are
          an outgrowth of the previous strike's ultimate failure. Both
          sides essentially agree on the financial aspects of a new
          contract, and pilots say they are prepared to make
          significant wage concessions because their main concerns
          center on job guarantees. Pilot negotiators say Eastern
          offered to provide only 510 jobs over the next three years
          for formerly striking pilots. The pilots also want to
          reattain their pre-strike seniority, but Eastern says it
          won't downgrade the replacement pilots who saw the company
          through the s Z=Y
             In a statement, the pilots union also charged that Eastern
          required that all pilot grievances, claims and lawsuits be
          dropped before any contract could be signed. The union said
          that included claims against Continental Airlines Holdings
          Inc. which holds the equity in Eastern and, until April,
          controlled the carrier. Continental Airlines Holdings is the
          new name for Texas Air Corp.
             Eastern, which countered by saying the pilots demanded
          that all litigation against the union be dropped, said those
          issues are "totally extraneous."
             Complicating dealings between the two sides is Eastern's
          status in bankruptcy court. Until spring, Eastern had been a
          unit of Texas Air, but Eastern's creditors grew frustrated by
          the constantly changing reorganization plans from Texas Air's
          chairman, Frank Lorenzo. In April, at the creditors request,
          the bankruptcy court removed Texas Air from day-to-day
          management and appointed a trustee, Martin R. Shugrue. Mr.
          Shugrue has consistently maintained that labor peace is one
          of his goals, but so far he has had no luck in negotiating
          with either the pilots or the still-striking machinists.
          Pilots have charged that Mr. Shugrue's words are a "stalling
          tactic."
             Furthermore, despite bankruptcy court protection, Eastern
          continues to be unprofitable. The airline has said its
          break-even load factor, the percentage of seats it needs to
          fill, stands at 80%. But in May, load factor was 54%. June
          traffic hasn't been disclosed yet.

HL           Southmark Is Facing a Familiar Foe
             As Evergreen Seeks Ailing Partnerships
             ----
             By Karen Blumenthal
             Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

IN     *  BANKRUPTCIES (BCY)
          TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)
TX           DALLAS -- The folks at Evergreen Property Capital Corp.
          say they can solve the thorny problems facing some of
          Southmark Corp.'s limited partnerships.
             There's just one catch: They are some of the same people
          who helped create the problems.
             As former top executives of Southmark/Envicon Capital
          Corp., John Galston and Eugene Rosen helped package and sell
          interests in dozens of Southmark private limited partnerships
          that raised nearly $400 million. The partnerships, which
          invested in health-care properties and other real estate,
          were sold to thousands of individual investors who could
          afford to pony up $25,000 to $150,000 each.
             Now, many of the partnerships are in trouble, and Messrs.
          Galston and Rosen have asked their former customers to trust
          them once again. They want investors to join their Limited
          Partner Investor Monitoring Committee and help wrest control
          from Southmark of 33 partnerships into which investors sank
          $130 million to $140 million.
             Sales of limited partnerships bolstered the rapid growth
          of Southmark -- once a highflying real estate and thrift
          concern -- and contributed to its equally quick demise.
             During much of the 1980s, Southmark bought real estate and
          resold it to limited partners, often booking large profits.
          Based partly on that apparent financial success, Southmark
          was able to sell almost $1 billion in junk bonds with the
          help of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., becoming the nation's
          largest publicly traded real-estate concern.
             But when tax-law changes stalled syndication sales and a
          real-estate recession depressed asset values, Southmark's
          cash flow disappeared. Short of funds, it sought
          bankruptcy-law protection in July 1989. Meanwhile, its
          continued cash bind and its need to cut staff left it
          ill-prepared to aid its 335 public and private partnerships
          or advise the 145,000 people who invested $2 billion in the
          partnerships.
             Campaigning against Southmark, New York-based Evergreen
          claims to have received enough proxies to replace Southmark
          as general partner of 33 private partnerships that own mostly
          health-care properties. Southmark responded by seeking a
          court restraining order to stop Evergreen from "unabashedly,
          unapologetically attempting to gain control" of the
          partnerships.
             Southmark filed eight pages of what it alleged were
          misrepresentations by Evergreen principals, including their
          purported failure to disclose their former roles in directing
          the limited partnerships. A state district judge in Dallas
          denied Southmark's request for a restraining order against
          Evergreen, and the parties are now negotiating a resolution
          of the general partner question, among other issues.
             The negotiations have an added urgency because of hearings
          scheduled this week on the confirmation of Southmark's
          proposed reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
          Bankruptcy Code. Southmark and its attorneys are scurrying to
          clear up any potential hurdles that could trip up the plan.
             Southmark doesn't dispute that its partnerships should
          have new general partners who could then choose management
          companies to run partnership properties and work on revising
          loan agreements. Because many of the properties currently
          don't generate enough cash flow to make debt payments, "to
          survive long-term, these partnerships are going to need (new)
          capital," says Bruce Schnitz, Southmark executive vice
          president. But, he says, Southmark is "trying to be cautious
          in trying to find" new general partners.
             Certainly, many of Southmark's partnership investors would
          like a change. Since Southmark initiated Chapter 11
          bankruptcy reorganization a year ago, it has stopped
          subsidizing distributions to partners and halted mortgage
          payments on some properties, putting them in danger of
          foreclosure. Auditors have questioned whether many of the
          partnerships can continue as going concerns.
             Individually, however, investors have almost no say in how
          the partnerships are run, and few have the deep pockets or
          knowledge to round up the support of other investors and
          challenge Southmark in trying to salvage troubled properties.
          That makes them dependent on whatever arrangements Southmark
          and groups like Evergreen can agree on.
             But whether the Evergreen group offers a worthwhile
          alternative is another question. The group and its Limited
          Partner Investor Monitoring Committee have been sharply
          critical of Southmark for failing to live up to its
          projections for the partnerships and have raised questions
          about accounting practices since the partnerships were first
          offered. The committee provided analyses of Southmark
          partnerships to investors for a fee of about 1% of their
          original investment, or about $250 on an investment of
          $25,000.
             What the committee glosses over is that Messrs. Galston
          and Rosen helped put together those projections and monitored
          the 33 partnerships and many others as the top executives of
          Southmark/Envicon Capital, the unit that marketed private
          partnership interests.
             In its request for a restraining order, Southmark claims
          that the executives, among other things, "were involved in
          determining the price and financial structure of the property
          to be acquired by the partnerships . . . developing the
          schedule of the limited partners' capital contributions;
          structuring the distribution guarantees (and) preparing the
          offering memorandum distributed to investors."
             More particularly, Southmark alleged in the filing, "Mr.
          Galston has failed to disclose to the limited partners that
          he played a major role in management decisions in his
          capacity as a general partner of the entity that served as a
          general partner of the partnerships."
             Mr. Galston, who left Southmark with Mr. Rosen in August
          1988, after the partnership business dried up, contends that
          he and his partners simply relied on numbers and data put
          together by others at Southmark. He said the two men were
          responsible primarily for selling the partnership interests,
          while others handled the operations and accounting.
             "We feel we were duped as well," Mr. Galston says. "We put
          the (offering) documents together based on information put
          together by operating divisions."
             But, argues William S. Friedman, the former vice chairman
          of Southmark, "it's a little disingenuous for them to
          criticize their own work and say you ought to pay us to fix
          things. I don't think a group of extremely well-compensated
          former executives should be looked on as potential saviors."
             Messrs. Galston and Rosen argue that if they are elected,
          they will try to negotiate lower management fees for the
          partnership properties. Currently, the partnerships pay about
          5% to 7.5% of their revenue to property managers, many of
          which are Southmark affiliates.
             However, Messrs. Galston and Rosen are asking limited
          partners to pay a separate fee equal to 1.75% of revenues to
          their committee as a general partner's fee; in most cases,
          the limited partners already paid fees for a Southmark unit
          to be general partner when they purchased partnership
          interests.
             Meanwhile, Southmark says in its lawsuit that changing the
          general partner could trigger debt covenants that may
          automatically put some properties in default. Many of those
          mortgages are with San Jacinto Savings Association, a
          Southmark unit, or other Southmark affiliates.
             The Evergreen principals dispute Southmark's reading of
          the debt covenants, saying that Southmark is actually
          threatening to have its affiliates foreclose on the
          properties.
             Southmark's private-partnership investors aren't the only
          ones under siege. Quest Partners, formed by two former
          Southmark salesmen, solicited votes from investors to become
          the general partner of three public Southmark partnerships.
          The roughly 8,000 investors in those partnerships voted last
          month on Quest's solicitation; a final tabulation is expected
          within a few weeks.
             Southmark already lost its general partner interest in a
          public health-care partnership to Life Care Centers of
          America, a closely held company. In part because Life Care
          currently manages some Southmark-sponsored properties,
          Southmark recently agreed to merge its partly owned National
          Heritage Inc. unit with Life Care and turn over general
          partner interests in many health-care partnerships to the
          Cleveland, Tenn., company. Southmark also is trying to sell a
          package of its general partner interests and mortgages in
          more than 200 partnerships, as part of its plan to quit the
          partnership business and emerge from bankruptcy largely as a
          thrift-holding company.
             The partnership tug-of-wars can be trying for even the
          most seasoned of investors. Consider Frank Loudermilk, a
          retired Kentucky lobbyist, who in 1987 sank $100,000 into a
          Southmark/Envicon partnership that purchased a Florida
          nursing home. That partnership will be managed by Life Care
          if the Life Care-National Heritage merger goes through.
             No investment rookie, Mr. Loudermilk didn't invest until
          he had pored over documents and even visited the thriving
          facility. But even though the nursing home is 97.5% occupied,
          it loses money because of the large interest payments on its
          debt, according to partnership financial statements.
             Mr. Loudermilk, acknowledging that he is "completely
          confused," decided that he wouldn't vote in the proxy battle,
          even though he sent in some money to the Evergreen group.
          Instead, he will wait to see if Southmark's agreement with
          Life Care improves the future of his investment.

TX           DALLAS -- Greyhound Lines Inc., which filed for protection
          under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy code last month,
          said it agreed to resume paying its former parent company,
          Greyhound Dial Corp., for rentals and leases on 15 major bus
          terminals, a New York city maintenance facility and about
          2,000 buses.
             Phoenix, Ariz.-based Greyhound Dial officials estimated
          the payments at about $3.8 million a month.
             J. Michael Doyle, Greyhound Lines senior vice president
          and chief financial officer, said the agreement would permit
          Greyhound Lines to develop its reorganization plan without
          having to spend time deciding whether to assume or reject
          hundreds of leases held by Greyhound Dial, which retains a
          22.5% stake in the closely held bus company.
             Greyhound Lines and five other units of GLI Holding Co.
          filed for bankruptcy law protection last month in
          Brownsville, Texas, following a financially devastating
          strike by the Amalgamated Transit Union.
             Although the agreement was filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy
          Court in Brownsville, federal Judge Richard S. Schmidt was
          not asked to approve it, although he has permitted Greyhound
          Lines to use current revenue to meet operating expenses.

TX           Amdura Corp. said a federal district court approved the
          sale of assets in its subsidiary Coast to Coast Stores Inc.,
          to Servistar Corp., a dealer-owned hardware cooperative based
          in Butler, Pa.
             The Coast to Coast unit sells hardware to individually
          owned retail stores operating under the Coast to Coast
          franchise. The asset sale will include inventory, two
          distribution centers and such intangibles as the Coast to
          Coast trademark. The sale, expected to close within 35 days,
          is being valued by the companies between $59 million and $75
          million.
             Amdura, a Denver-based automotive and hardware distributor
          and specialty manufacturer, bought CoastAmerica Corp., the
          parent company of Coast to Coast Stores, only two years ago.
          But the resulting debt of more than $260 million proved to be
          more than Amdura could handle, forcing it this past April to
          seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
          federal Bankruptcy Code.
             Approximately 1,100 stores are involved in the sale.
          According to the sales agreement, they will operate as a
          separate unit of Servistar.
             An Amdura spokesman also acknowledged that the company is
          still soliciting bids for Amdura National Distributing Co.,
          another hardware distributor, but declined to further

TX           CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- CCAIR Inc., a commuter airline that
          feeds passengers to USAir, said it filed for protection under
          Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, citing cash-flow
          problems.
             CCAIR, which is among several carriers that does business
          as USAir Express, said it has suffered a cash squeeze since
          USAir, the Arlington, Va.-based carrier with which it has a
          marketing agreement, began paying it on a monthly basis
          instead of weekly. The switch came after USAir Group Inc.,
          the parent of USAir, acquired Piedmont Airlines, the carrier
          that CCAIR had cooperated with.
             "Our traffic is good and we've got a lot of good
          employees," said J. Edward Bacon Jr., vice president-sales
          and services at CCAIR. "It's basically just a cash-flow
          problem."
             Mr. Bacon said negotiations for a line of credit recently
          fell through, prompting the bankruptcy-law petition, which
          was filed yesterday in federal bankruptcy court here. He said
          the bankruptcy filing listed assets of $26 million and
          liabilities of $13 million. He said the commuter line is
          continuing to ope.:e.
             A USAir spokeswoman wouldn't comment. The two carriers are
          unrelated in ownership, but have a marketing agreement under
          which CCAIR provides commuter feeder service to USAir at its
          Charlotte hub. CCAIR flies to 23 cities in North Carolina,
          South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia and West
          Virginia.
             For the third quarter ended March 31, CCAIR had a loss of
          $1.5 million, or 26 cents a share, on revenue of $15.5
          million. That compared with a loss of $350,999, or seven
          cents a share, on revenue of $13.7 million in the
          year-earlier period.
             Under Chapter 11, a company continues to operate under
          protection from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan
          to pay its debts.

TX           Leaders of Eastern Airlines's machinists union are
          scheduled to meet with officials of Northwest Airlines later
          this week to discuss a possible integration of the carriers,
          according to people familiar with the talks.
             It's unclear whether NWA Inc.'s Northwest unit would be
          interested in buying all of Eastern, currently operating
          under bankruptcy-court protection, or just some assets.
          Northwest, based in St. Paul, Minn., declined to comment on
          such a purchase, although it's understood it might want to
          buy some of Eastern's gates in Atlanta as well as the
          carrier's maintenance facility there. Eastern is a unit of
          Continental Air Holdings Inc.
             People familiar with the machinists union, however, say
          that Northwest would absorb Eastern's entire system. Those
          people say leaders of the machinists union will meet with
          Alfred Checchi, Northwest's chairman, this week.
             An Eastern spokesman declined to comment on any talks.
          However, in a company newsletter sent to employees last
          month, Eastern said that Northwest and Pan Am Corp., New
          York, had approached it to discuss "the possibility of future
          business relationships." Eastern wouldn't rule out "either
          the possibility of a merger with another carrier or a
          buy-out," the newsletter said.

TX           A group of major creditors in the Greyhound Lines Inc.
          federal bankruptcy case filed a change of venue motion
          seeking to move the Chapter 11 proceedings from Brownsville,
          Texas, to Dallas, headquarters of GLI Holding Co., parent
          company of Greyhound and five other subsidiaries involved in
          the case.
             The creditors' group includes Security Pacific Business
          Credit Inc., a unit of Security Pacific Corp., and other
          secured lenders who had provided Greyhound with $50 million
          in term loans and a $110 million revolving credit facility
          prior to Greyhound's Chapter 11 filing last month.
             The Security Pacific group alleges that the
          Brownsville-based Eagle Manufacturing Company Inc., one of
          the GLI units involved, accounts for only a small percentage
          of GLI's revenue and that most of the corporation's
          executives and business records are in Dallas.
             Arguing that the Eagle plant represents one of the
          country's largest concentrations of GLI employees, Greyhound
          attorneys said they would oppose the move. No hearings have
          been scheduled.

GV        SUPREME COURT (SUP)
          JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)
TX           A libel suit involving a letter to the editor of a
          scientific journal has emerged as a test case of whether New
          York state, home to many of the nation's media companies,
          will make statements of opinion immune from defamation suits.
             The state's highest court dismissed a libel suit filed by
          Immuno AG concerning the letter to the editor. But the U.S.
          Supreme Court threw out the decision last week and ordered
          the state court to reconsider the case in light of its recent
          ruling in Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal Co.
             In Milkovich, the Supreme Court ruled that under the First
          Amendment of the U.S. Constitution there is no special
          immunity from libel suits based on expressions of opinion.
          But that doesn't prevent individual states' courts from
          deciding that their own state constitutions implicitly offer
          such immunity.
             Courts in 36 states and the District of Columbia had ruled
          that statements of opinion can't form the basis of libel
          lawsuits, but in many instances it was unclear whether such
          rulings were based on federal or state constitutional law.
          The U.S. Supreme Court ruling will now force many of those
          courts to explicitly determine whether or not state
          constitutions afford such protection.
             The current case arose from a letter published in the
          December 1983 issue of the Journal of Medical Primatology
          that criticized a plan by Immuno to set up a facility in
          Sierra Leone to breed chimpanzees to use for the testing of
          medical products. The letter was written by Shirley McGreal,
          head of the International Primate Protection League, an
          organization concerned with the welfare of primates. Immuno,
          a multinational concern based in Vienna that manufactures
          products derived from blood plasma, alleged that the letter
          was false and defamatory. The only remaining defendant in the
          case is Jan Moor-Jankowski, co-founder and editor of the
          publication.
             The stakes in the Immuno case are particularly high
          because so many media companies are based in New York. In
          addition, media defense lawyers said the New York court is
          influential in libel law and its decision could affect how
          other states resolve the issue.
             Robert G. Sugarman of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, an attorney
          for Dr. Moor-Jankowski, said he believes the New York
          Constitution does provide protection from libel suits based
          on opinions. He said he will ask the court to reaffirm its
          earlier ruling as it previously determined that the facts
          that formed the basis for the opinions in the letter were
          true.
             But Raymond S. Fersko of Tanner Propp Fersko & Sterner, an
          attorney for Immuno, disagreed. He said: "I don't think
          there's a basis for {stating} that what the framers of the
          New York state Constitution had in mind was expanding First
          Amendment protections in libel cases in a situation like
          this."

             TEENAGE MUTANT Ninja Turtles spawn court battle over
          licensing.
             A New York state court in Long Island will hear arguments
          Thursday on whether to dismiss a $281 million lawsuit against
          the licensing agent and creators of the Turtles, comic-book
          characters who are the basis for an animated television
          series and movie.
             The characters have earned millions of dollars from
          manufacturers that hold licensing agreements to put them on
          everything from posters to frozen pizzas. They also appear as
          action-figure toys and on T-shirts. The characters were
          created by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman, partners in Mirage
          Studios, of Northampton, Mass. The licensing agent is Mark
          Freedman, president of Surge Licensing Inc., Jericho, N.Y.
             The suit was filed by Licensing Development Group Inc., a
          New York company formed in 1987 to find products and license
          them for manufacturing. It contends that Mr. Freedman
          deceived it by secretly acquiring and exploiting the
          licensing rights to the Turtles while he was serving as the
          company's president and chief executive officer.
             The suit alleges that Mr. Freedman should have been
          seeking the licensing right on behalf of Licensing
          Development Group, and that his actions breached his
          fiduciary duty to the company. It also contends that Messrs.
          Laird and Eastman induced him to violate his fiduciary
          responsibilities. Playmate Toys Inc., a La Mirada, Calif.,
          company that makes Ninja Turtle toys, also is named as a
          defendant.
             Jerome Halperin, a New York attorney for Mr. Freedman,
          said he has asked the court to dismiss the suit. "It has no
          merit either in law or fact," he said. "It's a worthless
          lawsuit."
             Frederick U. Fierst, an attorney in Northampton for
          Messrs. Laird and Eastman, said the allegations are totally
          without foundation. Richard Sallis, a senior vice president
          of Playmate Toys, said he had never heard of LDG and didn't
          know anything about the lawsuit.

             SUIT AGAINST TRUMP over hiring of construction workers
          goes to trial.
             A class-action lawsuit on behalf of construction workers
          went to trial in federal court in Manhattan. The suit alleges
          that Donald Trump and others conspired to cheat the union's
          pension and welfare funds by hiring immigrants without work
          papers off the books and under-reporting the number of
          employees on the job. The workers were hired for demolition
          work to make room for the construction of the Trump Tower in
          1980.
             Milton S. Gould, of Shea & Gould, an attorney for Mr.
          Trump and Equitable Life Assurance Society, which was a
          partner in the project, said Mr. Trump was sued only "because
          they needed somebody with deep pockets."
             "There will be no proof that {Mr. Trump or Equitable}
          dictated, suggested, or even hinted at who should or should
          not be listed on any reports" of workers at the job site, Mr.
          Gould said in his opening statement. "There is no proof that
          {they} committed any act which furthered a breach of trust"
          involving the funds.
             Mr. Gould said the labor agreement under which the
          demolition work was being done was between a contractor and
          the workers. He said Mr. Trump had nothing to do with that
          agreement.
             The lawsuit, filed in 1983, seeks damages of $1 million.
          The nonjury trial is being heard by federal Judge Charles
          Stewart.

             BANKRUPTCY JUDGE reluctant to approve contempt charges
          against Kuhn.
             U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Prudence B. Abram, in New York, said
          she was reluctant to hold Bowie Kuhn and his lawyers in
          contempt for proceeding with a suit against former partners
          of Mr. Kuhn's now-defunct law firm, Myerson & Kuhn. But the
          judge said she was concerned that the firm's bankruptcy
          proceeding "go forward with some degree of orderliness."
             Myerson & Kuhn's bankruptcy lawyers asked Judge Abram to
          hold Mr. Kuhn and his law firm in contempt for allegedly
          violating a restraining order that prohibited Mr. Kuhn and
          his lawyers from "commencing, continuing or prosecuting
          litigation" against former partners of the now-defunct firm.
          Mr. Kuhn's lawyers at Kelley Drye & Warren say that neither
          they nor Mr. Kuhn have violated the order.
             Marine Midland Bank had sued Mr. Kuhn, the former baseball
          commissioner, seeking to recover about $3 million in debt
          that he had personally guaranteed for the firm. Mr. Kuhn, in
          turn, sued his former partners for their share of the debt.
             In a hearing about the contempt motion, Judge Abram
          appeared impatient with Mr. Kuhn's lawyers and said "it is
          possible for some people to turn anything into a three-ring
          circus." But she said her main concern was to ensure that all
          the parties understood what actions were barred by her
          restraining order. The judge said she would take the contempt
          motion "under advisement."
             Richard Cohen, who represents Myerson & Kuhn in the
          bankruptcy proceeding, said in an affidavit filed last week
          that Mr. Kuhn's action against the partners had cost Myerson
          & Kuhn more than $10,000 in legal fees that he should now
          reimburse.

             HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING fight gets set for round one in court.
             James "Buster" Douglas, the heavyweight boxing champ,
          claims promoter Don King sided with Mr. Douglas's opponent,
          Mike Tyson, in their title fight last February. Thus, Mr.
          Douglas says, he can drop out of his contract with Mr. King
          and claim at least $10 million in monetary damages to boot.
             Mr. King, who has promotion contracts with both Mr.
          Douglas and Mr. Tyson, denies any unfair dealings and seeks
          at least $25 million in damages from Mr. Douglas for reneging
          on their deal. The bout is set to begin today in federal
          court in New York.

             The New York law firm has formed an affiliation with
          Chandler & Thong-Ek, an 18-lawyer firm in Bangkok. Chandler
          lawyers will act as local counsel for Coudert clients on
          matters requiring knowledge of Thai law, and Coudert lawyers
          will assist the Thai law firm. With 370 lawyers, Coudert has
          offices in Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and
          Sidney.
             James B. Sitrick, Coudert's chairman, says the law firm
          decided to form the affiliation because the partners believe
          Thailand is on the verge of a business boom.
             He said the law firm represents American, Japanense,
          French and German companies who do business in Thailand.

TX           SAN FRANCISCO -- International Rectifier Corp. said a
          federal bankruptcy court in San Francisco didn't approve an
          agreement with Siliconix Inc. that would have settled
          patent-infringement litigation between the two companies.
             "The court feels it is premature to consider the agreement

             Siliconix, Santa Clara, Calif., filed for bankruptcy-law

TX           NEW YORK -- Campeau Corp.'s two retailing units posted a
          narrower cumulative loss of $27.2 million for May on
          depressed sales, reflecting lower inventory levels and the
          sluggish economy.
             In documents filed with the U.S. bankruptcy court in
          Cincinnati, Federated Department Stores Inc. said it had a
          loss of $17.8 million for the four weeks ended June 2, while
          Allied Stores Inc. had a loss of about $9.5 million. The
          losses, which compared favorably with the $33.5 million loss
          for the two units in the four-week period ended May 5, don't
          include bankruptcy court-related expenses.
             For the four weeks ended May 5, Federated had a loss of
          $18.1 million, and Allied had a loss of about $15.5 million.
          Results for these four weeks were restated.
             Revenue in May decreased slightly at Federated and Allied.
          Sales at Federated dropped 2.4% to $82.1 million for the four
          weeks ended June 2 against $84.1 million for the four weeks
          ended May 5. Revenue at Allied dropped 2.1% to $47.4 million
          from $48.4 million.
             In a statement, Allen Questrom, chairman and chief
          executive officer of Federated and Allied, said the May
          results had been anticipated. "There is no shortcut through
          this process," said Mr. Questrom. He added that he doesn't
          expect the performance at Federated and Allied to improve
          before the latter part of this year.
             In the court filing, Federated and Allied attributed the
          poor May results to a new merchandising strategy that
          includes lower inventory levels, fewer promotions, and the
          willingness to take markdowns on slow moving goods in order
          to bring in fresh stock.
             Federated and Allied also cited "a general weakening and
          slowdown" in the U.S. economy as well as "unseasonably cool
          and rainy weather," which hurt the sale of summer
          merchandise.
             "The cumulative losses are approaching the point of
          embarrassment, which leads me to believe an asset sale could
          be imminent," said Alan Millstein, publisher of the Fashion
          Network Report. "At best they may break even in August."
             A spokeswoman for Federated and Allied disagreed, noting
          that a plan of reorganization is still being developed.
          "Nothing substantive will be done prior to such a plan, which
          won't be completed before this fall," said Carol Sanger, vice
          president, corporate communications, for Federated and
          Allied.
             Several apparel manufacturers sounded optimistic about
          Federated and Allied's future despite the May results.
             "Everybody is concerned about the losses, but we are
          confident that we are going to be paid," said Howard Bloom,
          president of Chetta B Inc., a woman's apparel maker. "I've
          got the sense that they are straightening themselves out.
          They seem to be getting back to the normal way of doing
          business -- a sale at the end of the month, not every day."
             Bernard Holtzman, president, Harve Benard Ltd., a women's
          apparel maker, said he also believes that Federated and
          Allied are showing improvements. "May wasn't a great month
          for anybody at retail," said Mr. Holtzman. "Eventually
          they'll have a good business again. But they won't be able to
          fix all the problems overnight."
             Federated Department Stores consists of Bloomingdale's;
          Abraham & Straus; Lazarus, Rich's/Goldsmith's, and Burdines.
          Allied Stores consists of Jordan Marsh; Maas/Jordan Marsh
          (Florida); Stern's, and The Bon Marche.
             Federated and Allied filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
          protection Jan. 15.

TX           A federal bankruptcy judge gave LTV Corp. another 120 days
          to formulate a plan for repaying its creditors and emerging
          from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
             The Dallas company, which is approaching its four-year
          anniversary under Chapter 11 protection, had sought the new
          deadline for its reorganization plan prior to the U.S.
          Supreme Court's ruling that the company is liable for funding
          more than $2 billion in employee pension plans.
             LTV now has until Nov. 6 to present a reorganization plan
          to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland of New York. The
          company had been scheduled to present its plan early next
          week.
             None of the parties to LTV's reorganization objected to
          the extension.
             The Supreme Court ruled June 18 that LTV couldn't pass its
          liability for funding the pension plans to the federal
          Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., meaning that LTV's creditors
          are likely to receive much smaller payouts under a
          reorganization plan. The company, which filed for bankruptcy
          protection in July 1986, stopped funding the pension plans in
          1987.

          INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS)
TX           HOUSTON -- A federal bankruptcy judge dismissed Members
          Service Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing.
             Judge Randolph Wheless Jr. granted Members Service's
          request to dismiss its six-week-old bankruptcy court
          petition. The company said it sought court protection in late
          May after the Internal Revenue Service unexpectedly demanded
          payment for delinquent taxes.
             Members Service, which has holdings in telecommunications,
          energy and financial services, claimed the funds sought by
          the agency were the result of action by an "overzealous
          Internal Revenue agent." It acknowledged it had bought some
          companies with tax liabilities, but said it had met two IRS
          schedules for payment and was prepared to meet a third when
          the demand was made for accelerated payment.
             An IRS spokesman declined to comment on the company's
          charge regarding one of its agents. The spokesman said the
          agency has a lien pending against Members Service for $91,572
          for failure to withhold Social Security and federal income
          taxes. The lien, filed in Harris County here, is against
          three units, and has not been withdrawn, the IRS said.
             As for the payment schedules, the IRS-spokesman said,
          "they know something we don't know if they're talking about
          an installment agreement."
             James R. Beazle, executive vice president for Members
          Service, said he was unaware of any lien against the company
          and, contrary to the IRS's contention, Members Service had
          completed the IRS schedules for payment.

TX           NEW YORK -- Integrated Resources Inc., the former real
          estate syndicator operating under bankruptcy court
          protection, is informally circulating a reorganization plan
          to its creditors.
             Although details of the plan are still being negotiated,
          officials and creditors say Integrated envisions a three-step
          process whereby creditors initially would share between $300
          million and $350 million in cash raised largely through asset
          sales. The company currently has more than $200 million in
          cash in escrow.
             Integrated, which largely manages more than 600
          partnerships, then would segregate its contract rights to
          manage those partnerships and issue notes against them.
          Integrated estimates the contract rights at about $200
          million; the company would seek to sell the rights over a
          three-year period and then distribute proceeds to creditors.
             Creditors also would share an equity interest in the
          remaining company, which would specialize in hotel management
          and equipment leasing. Officials estimate that business to be
          valued at about $200 million. The company already has been
          scaling back its operating expenses and expects substantial
          reductions by year end. More staff reductions were made
          Friday, and officials expect the number of employees to be
          reduced from the current 500 to about 275 by year end.
             The plan hasn't been widely distributed to creditors, who
          are owed a total of about $1.8 billion. Those who have seen
          the plan are expected to respond to Integrated next week.
          Creditors seem generally satisfied about the speed with which
          the case is proceeding. Integrated entered bankruptcy
          proceedings in February; the federal Bankruptcy Court
          directed Integrated to submit a disclosure statement to
          creditors that should provide terms of the reorganization by
          July 26. Integrated's "exclusivity period," the time period
          in which only it can officially propose a reorganization plan
          under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, expires
          Sept. 11.
             Both Integrated officials and creditors view the
          resolution of issues among various creditor groups as the
          next big hurdle the company has to surmount in fashioning a
          plan. Although the overall plan has been set out, it isn't
          clear how the cash, notes and equity ultimately will be
          distributed among creditors.
             Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated chairman and chief
          executive officer, has said senior creditors, who are owed a
          total of about $1 billion, probably would receive about 45
          cents to 50 cents on the dollar. It's unclear what junior
          creditors, who are owed about $600 million, might receive,
          but it would be "substantially less" than what senior
          creditors can expect. There are about $200 million in general
          unsecured claims.

TX           TORONTO -- Robert Campeau and National Bank of Canada were
          silent this weekend about whether Mr. Campeau had made a
          first payment of 40 million Canadian dollars (US$34.2
          million) to retrieve his Campeau Corp. securities seized by
          the bank.
             Mr. Campeau, chairman and chief executive officer of the
          Toronto real estate and retailing company, had until midnight
          Saturday to come up with the money. National Bank, based in
          Montreal, seized the securities in January after Mr. Campeau
          defaulted on personal loans amounting to C$153 million. Mr.
          Campeau previously faced a deadline of May 31 to make a first
          payment, but that deadline was extended.
             The new deadline fell as Campeau Corp. reported a widening
          loss for its first quarter ended April 30.
             After National Bank's seizure of securities, Mr. Campeau's
          fully diluted stake in Campeau Corp. fell to about 21% from
          43%. The securities included 13 million Campeau Corp. common
          shares, C$60.4 million of convertible debentures and four
          million convertible preference shares.
             Under Mr. Campeau's agreement with National Bank, he was
          to pay a further C$40 million by Jan. 31, 1992, or, failing
          that, pledge the C$60.4 million of debentures back to the
          bank. National Bank agreed to vote the securities seized
          according to Mr. Campeau's direction.
             Separately, Campeau Corp. said that Edward J. DeBartolo
          Corp., a Youngstown, Ohio, developer, agreed to extend to
          July 20 an agreement not to call its US$480 million loan
          without first giving nine days' notice. The agreement, which
          has been extended several times, was due to expire Saturday.
          A similar agreement with the Reichmann family's Olympia &
          York Developments Ltd. doesn't have an expiry date.
             Campeau Corp. defaulted in January on the DeBartolo loan
          and on US$225 million remaining in a loan from Olympia & York
          when its U.S. retailing units, Federated Department Stores
          Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy
          protection. In March, Campeau Corp. refused to pay interest
          due on the loans.
             Campeau Corp. itself hasn't filed for bankruptcy or
          liquidation in Canada, but it has said it plans to seek
          approval at the July 30 annual meeting to dispose of a
          "substantial portion" of its Canadian real estate assets to
          reduce debt.
             For its first quarter, Campeau Corp. reported a loss of
          US$80 million, or $1.87 a share. A year earlier, it had a
          loss of $67 million, or $1.65 a share. Revenue rose slightly
          to $2.26 billion from $2.23 billion.
             The latest period's result included a $47 million gain
          from the sale of assets, compared with a gain of $98 million
          a year earlier. The company also had a $21 million charge in
          the most recent period related to Chapter 11 reorganization
          costs. There wasn't a similar charge a year earlier.
             Operating profit declined to $185 million from $213
          million. Operating profit, defined as earnings before
          interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and costs related
          to Chapter 11 reorganization, is considered the most accurate
          measure of a business under Chapter 11.

       *  BANKRUPTCIES (BCY)
          BIOGRAPHY (BIO)
TX           At last A. Robert Abboud can truly call himself a Texas
          banker.
             After two years of broadcasting nothing but good news from
          First city Bancorp. of Texas, the Houston bank holding
          company he helped rescue in 1988, the former Chicagoan
          suddenly finds himself grappling with troubles all too
          familiar to natives of the Lone Star state. Rising problem
          loans. Falling profits. And, above all, skepticism on Wall
          Street.
             "Their near-term picture is spotty and deserves a lot of
          scrutiny," says James J. McDermott Jr., a banking analyst
          with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., who calls recent trends
          "alarming."
             Mr. Abboud didn't do much to calm such worries when he
          disclosed that he expects First city's second-quarter profit
          to fall to 75 cents to 95 cents a share from $1.08 a year
          earlier -- the first such decline since he took the helm in
          April 1988. Worse, he said that nonperforming assets,
          including several questionable credits to such debt-laden
          outfits as Circle K Corp., were likely to jump to $200
          million, 43% above the year-end total. The news drove First
          city stock down two points in New York Stock Exchange
          composite trading Friday. The stock closed at $26.25 a share,
          a new 52-week low.
             Of course, bad news isn't exactly a rare commodity in the
          banking world these days. Across the country, credit quality
          fears and dwindling interest margins are depressing bank
          stocks and forcing painful personnel changes.
             But until lately, Mr. Abboud and First city had seemed
          almost bullet-proof. For starters, the deal the banker
          structured to take over First city two years ago cleansed the
          books of most problems, including sour real estate loans and
          Third World credits, and brought in nearly $1.5 billion in
          federal aid and private equity. That enabled him to start
          lending again while most of his Texas competitors were still
          mired in workouts.
             What's more, the feisty 61-year-old brought with him a
          carefully cultivated image as a tight-fisted lender. In the
          late 1970s, as chairman and chief executive of First Chicago
          Corp., Mr. Abboud braved fierce criticism from the local
          business community by slamming the brakes on loan growth.
          Although many now credit him with preventing the bank from
          following crosstown rival Continental Illinois Corp. into
          collapse, at the time his actions helped get him fired. "It
          was a little like trying to persuade hedonists to forgo
          earthly pleasures and wait for their reward in the
          hereafter," Mr. Abboud wrote in his autobiography, "Money in
          the Bank."
             But now some in the industry are wondering if Mr. Abboud
          hasn't succumbed to the siren call of quick profits. Last
          year, First city's loans rose 15% to $8.22 billion, a
          blistering pace considering the spotty nature of Texas's
          economic recovery, and much faster than deposit growth.
             By contrast, total lending by all Texas banks shrank
          during the period. "Finding quality loans is quite
          difficult," says Ronald G. Steinhart, chairman of Fort Worth,
          Texas-based Team Bank, which was also resurrected with
          federal aid. "We don't see {First city} doing crazy things,
          but we see them being the most aggressive" lenders.
             Some of First city's early credit decisions are coming
          back to haunt it. Since the beginning of the year, four major
          out-of-state borrowers that owe the bank a collective $72.5
          million have trooped into federal bankruptcy court: Drexel
          Burnham Lambert Inc.; Circle K, the convenience store chain;
          Federated Department Stores Inc.; and Garfinckel's Inc., a
          department-store chain owned by Mr. Abboud's longtime friend
          Wafic Said.
             "It seems to be the same story we so frequently see in
          banking," says Sandra Flannigan, an analyst with Alex. Brown
          & Sons, Baltimore. "Any time a bank grows its loan portfolio
          at a pace far greater than the expansion of loan demand
          within the region, it's often followed by problems and losses
          in the portfolio."
             Not surprisingly, that isn't the way Mr. Abboud sees it.
          "I certainly hope I haven't lost my reputation as a
          conservative lender, because I consider myself one," he says.
          He acknowledges that First city has moved to tighten credit
          policies this year, particularly in the wholesale lending
          department, which participates in large national credits such
          as leveraged buy-outs. The bank is also trying to direct more
          loans to the Texas market, which Mr. Abboud believes is
          poised to take off.
             But he denies that First city has made a habit of
          extending risky loans. If the bank has cut some deals others
          weren't comfortable with, that might be because the credits
          involved particularly complex financial arrangements, he
          says, not because they were unwise.
             The Garfinckel's loan, he says, is a case in point.
          Although the company has filed for bankruptcy-court
          protection from creditors, First city hasn't even felt
          obliged to place the credit on nonperforming status. Of the
          initial $21 million Garfinckel's owed, First city has already
          received a $7.5 million cash paydown. A revolving credit
          facility of $3.8 million is secured by customer receivables
          of nearly twice that amount, and the remainder of the loan is
          secured both by the store's assets and by a contract that
          would allow the bank to "put" the credit to a third party,
          Mr. Abboud says.
             First city also says it is confident it will win full
          repayment on the Drexel, Circle K and Federated facilities.
          "I'm comfortable that {nonperformers} are flattened out," Mr.
          Abboud says. He also points out that nonperformers remain a
          relatively low 1.4% of total assets and that the bank's
          capital position is quite strong.
             And if there are a few more rough spots along the way, Mr.
          Abboud doesn't seem worried. Indeed, with the sort of
          contrarianism that has long confounded friends and foes
          alike, Mr. Abboud vows to continue pushing First city into
          areas other banks have shied from, such as international
          trade finance.
             He even says he might try to capitalize on First city's
          recent troubles by marketing its expertise in managing
          difficult loans to other banks. "We know how to work out of
          problems," he says. "I think that's a very valuable resource
          at this particular time."

TX           A U.S. bankruptcy court judge ordered the Chapter 11
          proceedings of holding companies of Federated Department
          Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. moved from San Francisco
          to Cincinnati.
             The unusual transfer is the result of one of the most
          hotly contested disputes in the bankruptcy proceedings of the
          two Campeau Corp. retail units. Allied bondholders argued
          that the holding company cases should be heard in Cincinnati,
          where the retail units filed for bankruptcy-court protection
          Feb. 15. Four other Federated and Allied creditors committees
          supported the request for the transfer.
             At a hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Lloyd King
          in San Francisco, Issac M. Pachulski, an attorney for
          Federated Stores Inc., and other holding companies argued
          that the cases should remain in San Francisco because Ralph's
          Grocery Stores Inc., partly owned by one of the network of
          four holding companies, is located in California.
             Jonathan M. Jacobson, an attorney for Allied bondholders,
          said that the proceedings should be heard by U.S. bankruptcy
          court Judge J. Vincent Aug, Jr., in Cincinnati, because the
          affairs of the holding companies and retail units are
          "completely enmeshed."
             Separately, Allied has announced an agreement with
          Chemical Banking Corp. for a new loan facility to finance its
          receivables. The arrangement replaces a Citibank financing
          that expires today. The agreement calls for $630 million in
          receivables financing but can be increased to $700 million.
          The loans will be funded by commercial paper. A spokeswoman
          for Chemical said this will be the first time a company in
          Chapter 11 proceedings has been able to access the commercial
          paper market. The agreement must be approved by Judge Aug.
