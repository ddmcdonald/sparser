#| See testing code in these files:
 [analyzers;tokenizer:testing]
     Speed tests for the tokenizer and other lowerlevel actions.
     Some test strings like *2k-the*
 [analysers;char-level:testing]
     Speed tests for buffer-filling and test of buffer contents
     Includes minimal loop for testing the overhead.
