;;;   Version:   August 2014

;; initiated 7/15/13 to provide a general facility for automating
;; the construction and management of resources. 9/17/13 Got it to
;; turn over and do useful things, but still has loose ends.
;; 3/24/14 Added a facility for automatic the find-or-make setup.
;; 8/28/14 Implemented the resource incrementer.

The type that we create
It's initialization method
its reclaim method
Its clean method

with a kons list
an init function
  which creates an alloq
the instance need to put itself somewhere that we can get it back 
from, perhaps a global table


That's a pack of methods, so the resource initialization has to 
make them according to the spec given in the class instance
