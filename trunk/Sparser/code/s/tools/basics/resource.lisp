#| 
The type that we create
It's initialization method
its reclaim method
Its clean method

with a kons list
an init function
  which creates an alloq
the instance need to put itself somewhere that we can get it back 
from, perhaps a global table


That's a pack of methods, so the resource initialization has to 
make them according to the spec given in the class instance
