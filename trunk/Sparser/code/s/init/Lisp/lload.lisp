;;;      File:   "lload"
;;;    Module:   "init;Lisp:"
;;;   Version:   2.9 January 2007

;; initiated July 1990
;; 1.1  (7/19 v1.8.6)  Added capability to load .fasl or source, preferring
;;      fasls.
;; 1.2  (8/12 v1.9) Added Load-the-newest and patched Load-preferring-binaries
;;      to use it.
;; 1.3  (10/4 v2.0)  Reorganized the parameter design and added the facility
;;      for taking source files if they're newer than the fasl.
;; 1.4  (10/16 v2.0) fixed a bug in the computation of fasl namestrings, and
;;      added routines so that it wouldn't make a new fasl routine when there
;;      was one already there that was newer than the source.
;;      10/21 fixed use of "else", when it hadn't yet been defined
;;      10/22 Added the option for *just-note-changed-files*
;;      10/23 got the timing right on the reference to *time-of-image*
;; 1.5 (10/28 v2.0) wrote rest of routines needed to write copies of
;;     changed files to disk for transfer/backup.  11/1 added flags.
;; (11/25 v2.1) Added :compile keyword to LLoad, defaulted to T, so that
;;     some grammar files can be marked not to be compiled -- often avoiding
;;     wierd situations in the compiler.
;; 1.6 (12/4 v2.1) Folded in what Scott & I did at Brandeis, and modified
;;     it to also operate in non-MCL contexts.
;; 1.7 (2/10 v2.2)  Added "check-&-" to the bare calls to "load" that
;;     had been used in Compile-&-load. In Check-&-load added a form to
;;     push the file onto the files field of the current grammar module.
;;     Added Unless-bound-set to the end of the file so it could be included
;;     early and consistently in the loading process.
;; 2.0 (2/13/93) Converting to MCL2.0 -- reworking everything so that all
;;     operations are done in terms of namelists since the old Allegro
;;     notion of logicals is going away (no point in using the interim scheme
;;     they provide) and this already exists.
;; 2.1 (8/24) added Just-compile for the benefit of the compile-everything script
;;      and revitalized Special-hacks
;; 2.2 (9/8) tweeked Load-file? for benefit of incremental backup facility
;; 2.3 (9/28) wrote Copy-source-to-new-root and reorganized that whole notion
;; 2.3 (1/4/94) tweeking to make the raw form saved with the grammar module
;; 2.4 (3/24) updated Load-file? given changes to config;explicitly-loaded-files
;;      that added some more cases where the filename includes "load", and
;;      again 5/11
;;     (9/28) wrote Mac->Mac version of Copy-source-to-new-root
;; 2.5 (3/29/95) wrote Record-file-write-time facility. Added *raw-form-of-file*.
;;     (12/1) added *just-count-lines* and integrated it into LLoad
;; 2.6 (6/19/96) added another case of an explicit file to load when doing copy-files,
;;      and gave it a new keyword arg. to inhibit recursive loads 6/25.
;;     (8/18/97) and another case added to Load-file? for [bbn loader]
;; 2.7 (8/20) put a hack into Load-the-newest that when one of the files can't
;;      be found, load the other. Spelling bugs would be caught as in that
;;      neither would be found. 
;;     (8/24) modified Interpose-Unix-delimiter-in-namelist to add a slash at
;;      the very beginning of the filename, making the path absolute
;; 2.8 (10/3) Wrote Gload. (10/8) wrote Namestring-to-namelist. (12/6) extended
;;      the explicit list of files in Load-file?
;;     (1/5/07) Small tweaks to get a unix-based load on OSX.
;; 2.9 (1/23) Set of changes to get copy-file to work under Allegro. Goes through
;;      ACL's excl.shell:cp, but doesn't work. Didn't do further debugging.
;; 2.10 (8/29/07) Adding/modifying as needed to handle MSWindows file systems.

Gload should be used in place of lload for any file or module
that involves the grammar.

Gload provides a wrapper around a call to lload that does two things
in order to establish the alternative environments needed for
accomodating license deliveries where some of the grammar is
provided as source and consequently stored in a different place
that those parts of the delivered grammar (if any) that are
supplied as an unchangeable part of the image.
