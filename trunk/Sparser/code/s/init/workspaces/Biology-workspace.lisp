;;;  version:  June 2015

;; Initiated 11/6/13 to setup experiments in reading biology texts
;; and constructing process models from them.
;; 6/5/2015 added methods to control whether breaks and errors halt processing of articles
;; (defparameter *break-during-read* nil), break-in-articles,  dont-break-in-articles
;; 6/20/2015 added control prameter *load-ras2* that can be used to turn off the loading of
;; the large model while doing tests...
;; 7/11/2015 New method TJ to test a single article and add to a file
;;  current "~/r3/code/evaluation/no-cards.lisp" but should be made more parameterizable
;; all the sentences that mention RAS2 proteins. This is particularly useful to figure out why we are not generating cards for some articles

#|  5/13/15 (ddm)
This code is set up to take a list of article ids as given
by Mitre in their 5/4/15 email (*2015-5-4_Mitre-articles*)
and get them read.

Because things don't always work, it runs in three stages
and stores its results in the global variables just below.
1. Read the xml had create document objects
     (populate-article-set)
2. "Sweep" the document objects and populate their sentences
     (sweep-article-set)
3. Read the documents for their content
     (read-article-set)

The (untested) function load-and-read-article(id) would do all
those steps sequentially on a single article.

"Ras is a membrane bound protein.
When inactive, it is bound to the small molecule GDP.
Upon growth factor stimulation of the cell, an exchange factor,
such as the SOS protein,
causes ras to release GDP and and ras will now bind to GTP.
Binding to GTP causes a conformational change of the ras protein
that puts ras into the active state.
GTP-bound ras binds to the raf protein kinase.
This binding of raf to ras has the effect of
activating the raf kinase
and localizing the raf kinase to the cell membrane.
Activated raf now phosphorylates and activates the Mek1 kinase.
The Mek1 kinase then phosphorylates the ERK kinase
on both threonine and tyrosine residues
which activate ERK kinase activity.
The phosphorylated ERK protein then translocates to the nucleus
where it regulates gene expression
in part by phosphorylating the Elk1 transcription factor.
Phospho-Elk then upregulates the gene expression of target genes
such as the proto-oncogene c-fos.
The entire signaling cascade is terminated by
the intrinsic GTPase activity of ras
which hydrolyzes the bound GTP into GTP,
thus returning ras to the GDP bound state
where it releases bound raf.
The GTPase activity of ras is accelerated
by interaction with another protein called GAP.
The oncogenic rasv12 mutant has diminished GTPase activity
and therefore stays in the active GTP bound state constitutively.
Deletion of GAP or the related NF1 genes will also enhance ras activity
by slowing the rate of ras-GTP hydrolysis.")

We previously demonstrated that this tightly controlled event is regulated positively by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and its downstream kinase, IκB kinase α (IKKα).
However, the precise mechanisms by which NIK and IKKα induce p100 processing remain unclear.
Here, we show that, besides activating IKKα, NIK also serves as a docking molecule recruiting IKKα to p100.
This novel function of NIK requires two specific amino acid residues, serine 866 and serine 870, of p100 that are known to be essential for inducible processing of p100.
We also show that, after being recruited into p100 complex, activated IKKα phosphorylates specific serines located in both N- and C-terminal regions of p100 (serines 99, 108, 115, 123, and 872).
The phosphorylation of these specific serines is the prerequisite for ubiquitination and subsequent processing of p100 mediated by the β-TrCP ubiquitin ligase and 26 S proteasome, respectively.
These results highlight the critical but different roles of NIK and IKKα in regulating p100 processing and shed light on the mechanisms mediating the tight control of p100 processing.
These data also provide the first evidence for explaining why overexpression of IKKα or its activation by many other stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor and mitogens fails to induce p100 processing."

Accordingly, constitutive processing of p100, caused by the loss of its C-terminal processing inhibitory domain due to nfkappab2 gene rearrangements, is associated with the development of various lymphomas and leukemia. In contrast to the physiological processing of p100 triggered by NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) and its downstream kinase, IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha), which requires the E3 ligase, beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TrCP), and occurs only in the cytoplasm, the constitutive processing of p100 is independent of beta-TrCP but rather is regulated by the nuclear shuttling of p100. Here, we show that constitutive processing of p100 also requires IKKalpha, but not IKKbeta (IkappaB kinase beta) or IKKgamma (IkappaB kinase gamma). It seems that NIK is also dispensable for this pathogenic processing of p100. These results demonstrate a general role of IKKalpha in p100 processing under both physiological and pathogenic conditions. Additionally, we find that IKKalpha is not required for the nuclear translocation of p100. Thus, these results also indicate that p100 nuclear translocation is not sufficient for the constitutive processing of p100."

;;; OBO => Lisp
;;;-------------

#| We can read in a set of OBO files (in .obo format, not .owl),
convert them to a Lisp-readable form, then load the resulting
file into Sparser (or anything else) and operate on it.

The first step is to do the translation. It only has to be done
where there's a new version of the OBO files that we want to use.
Otherwise we're working with the result of the translation
The OBO files are in <R3 trunk>/ontologies/*.obo and date from
November 2014 when this machinery was set up.

The translation code is in <R3>/code/obo3lisp/obo2lisp.lisp.
As shown below, it takes a list of input obo files and writes
out another combined file with the results of the translation.

This is the code I used (ddm). It has to be modified to use
generic file names. This is all lisp code. The translator
is in cl-user. The rendered Lisp version of the OBO data
is in sparser.

(defun translate-obos ()  ;; (translate-obos)
 (cl-user::translate-obo-files
  '("/Users/ddm/ws/R3/trunk/ontologies/bfo.obo"
    "/Users/ddm/ws/R3/trunk/ontologies/ro.obo"

    "/Users/ddm/ws/R3/trunk/ontologies/pro.obo"
    "/Users/ddm/ws/R3/trunk/ontologies/chebi.obo"
    "/Users/ddm/ws/R3/trunk/ontologies/cl.obo")

  "~/ws/R3/rs/trunk/corpus/obo-terms.lisp")

The output file is a sequence of Lisp forms that replicate
all of the interesting information in the corresponding
.obo entry. The file has to be read in (which defines the Lisp
version of each entry) and then several additional operations
are carried to to make the terms accessible as possible
definitions of otherwise unknown words. These are all bundled
into the function incorporate-obo-terms which is packaged
below along with its required file argument. This and the
other operations on OBOs is defined in the file obo-reader.lisp
in words/one-offs.

These return the Lisp-based obo entries.
