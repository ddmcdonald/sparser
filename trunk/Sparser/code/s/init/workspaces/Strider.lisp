2do: 7/8/13
 - Run whole articles using Comlex
     - Debug the missing case that causes the error in phase one
     - write that up some
     - add a break option with *tts-after-each-section*
 - Setup a little bit of general segment handling (lifted from Grok)
   to give us a platform for noting named entities, and other items of interest
 - Why does person individual here (and elsewhere) have a plist full of rules?
 - Do the other titles and refine position-at-co to appreciate them
     head of Kadima
     leader of the opposition in the Knesset
       - probably entails predefining Kadima and the Knesset (ditto IDF)
       - which will require a useful extension of the conceptualization
         of named-entity
