Degree in the year 81. As part of his research for his B.Sc. course he collaborated with Reza Rustazad and Seyyed Abbas Musavi in a joint project on \"the manufacturing of polymeric membrane [ghesha] for separating gases\". Even at the beginning of his student days, he had published many articles on polymers in ISI [previous acronym given in English] under the name of Mostafa Ahmadi. The method that Ahmadi-Rowshan and his colleagues were working on was about a method for enriching uranium, because according to that method they had to use polymeric membranes for enriching uranium. In order to enrich uranium, at first uranium is turned into uranium hexafluoride gas, and then that gas is passed through a layer of polymeric membranes and this is how it is enriched.")

2do: 7/8/13
 - Run whole articles using Comlex
     - Debug the missing case that causes the error in phase one
     - write that up some
     - add a break option with *tts-after-each-section*
 - Setup a little bit of general segment handling (lifted from Grok)
   to give us a platform for noting named entities, and other items of interest
 - Why does person individual here (and elsewhere) have a plist full of rules?
 - Do the other titles and refine position-at-co to appreciate them
     head of Kadima
     leader of the opposition in the Knesset
       - probably entails predefining Kadima and the Knesset (ditto IDF)
       - which will require a useful extension of the conceptualization
