;; broken out into this form 9/93.
;; 2/23/95 changed definition of P to look for whether *workshop-window* was up, and
;; to inhibit TTs accordingly.  8/28 added Design.  2/9/05 Added ir to inspect
;; rules. (1/07) lots of little additions. 4/9/09 Changed 'inspect' to 'd'
;; 7/21/09 vrp serves as 'wrapper' for exporting output in speech act-inspired format
;; Modified through 9/11/09. 9/18 factored out the checkpoint massaging done in
;; pp to the new file /grammar/model/sl/checkpoing/post-processing.lisp
;; 3/15/13 Added p/art to simulate running a document stream.
;; 4/14 added ier for edge referents and binds for their bindings.
;; 10/9/13 added ietf. 10/17/13 augmented ic to get mixins. 11/18/14 added
;; drs for describe rule set, over words or categories. 1/7/15 Added
;; the names of the plist generics
;; 7/18\9/2015 (defun qepp (string)  ;; quiet, error-protected call to pp
