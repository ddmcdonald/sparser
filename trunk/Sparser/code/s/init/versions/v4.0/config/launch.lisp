;;;  version:  June 2011

;; 10/7/94 commented out the call to make objects permanent and move it to the
;; save images file. 10/12 turning off the break-outside-coverage flag
;; 12/12 gated a dm&p parameter.  1/30/95 gated a presentation parameter
;; 4/1 added *load-dossiers-into-image* gate.  8/9 added debugging flags
;; dispatch off of *known-machine*.  9/5 added check for delayed accessing
;; of corpus-data. 1/1/96 Bumped length of chart to avoid synch. glitch
;; in long-term-ification. 5/31 appear to have that glitch in hand so moved
;; the resource lengths back to normal values. 6/3 added check for whether
;; the grammar is loaded and the offer to do so and save a version with it
;; but not the dossiers.  6/5 reorganized the ordering of operations.  6/17
;; debugged some interactions with that.  6/27 adding further gates to the
;; loading of the corpus information. 6/28 added Load-workspaces. 8/16/97
;; Commented out the call to a switch setting (there isn't one now), and
;; gated the use of dossiers. 10/19 put back a hard-coded, non-gated setup
;; to use ddm/top-edges.. in Final-session-setup. Have to be more clever
;; about this soon. Also fixed namelist-to-namestring respelling glitch.
;; 8/7/07 small tweeks. 8/30 made load-workspaces O/S independent.
;; 4/7/09 fixed some fanout in files, neatened up, added a proper dispatch
;; to the switch settings.
;; 7/21/09 Flipped *display-word-stream* to nil. 8/31/09 Added *poirot-interface*
;; to the protocol switches options. 2/18/10 flipped *display-word-stream*
;; back again. We can locally override it for specific applications.
;; 6/17/11 changed top-edges-setting default to top-edges-setting/ddm because
;; it's missing some needed elements. 6/30/11 Commented out checkpoint-ops 
;; case in switch-settings because in and 'everything' load (the default
;; now) that option symbol is bound to a grammar module. Need a different
;; scheme.
