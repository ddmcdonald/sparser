;;;   version:  January 2015

;; broken out from loaders;master-loader 4/19/94. Added Whos-news-post-dossiers-loader
;;  4/29 added [words;whitespace assignments].  5/25 consolidated the
;;  adjuncts.  6/17 gated the call to the 2d loader for Who's News.
;;  7/13 uncommented loading of pronouns 7/22 put them under their own gate
;;  so they'd show up in the right place in the grammar menu.  8/10 reordered
;;  resource initializations now that they use kconses.  9/18 moved [analyzers;dm&p:
;;  measure] to the last point in the load so that all the categories will be
;;  defined before it loads.  10/12 move pct in from whos-news.  10/24 put a gate
;;  on the call to [syntax;loader] because none of those modules are showing up
;;  in the menu.  1/5/95 gated the HA loader, put in [newlines:loader].
;;  1/26 added *specific-sources*.  2/28 put gate around collections.
;;  3/18 reviewed all the calls to be sure they were via logicals.
;;  3/31 revised the gate on pronouns.   5/5 added *da* case.    7/13 revised
;;  the gate on core;pronoun.  11/9 ordered tree-families after syntax
;;  11/10 took it back.  12/20 broke out part of the loading of numbers, and
;;  added financials. 12/26 renamed financials to ern -- financials is empty as
;;  a core module. 1/13/96 gave financials back some content.  6/4 amended the
;;  gate for delayed loading.  6/5 added an additional gate around the 2d-stage
;;  loader for titles.  6/17 added edge types.  6/25 added some gates for copy-file
;;  and moved in some files that weren't within the grammar directory tree.
;; 7/21 added *nih*. 8/16/97 added gates for no model. 10/11 coverted over to gload.
;; 12/6 conditionalized loading of tree-families on *lattice-points*. 7/12/98 included
;; *ern* into the conditionalization. 12/13/99 added *kinds*. 3/18/00 conditionally
;; bumped the company loader to 2 for *lattice-points*. 3/21 ditto collections.
;; 5/1 moved collections and proper-names after tree families. 6/14 moved collections
;; after numbers to get the right category for 'number'. Moved companies after collections
;; and also numbers-part-2. 9/6 conditionalized finance and amounts to *lattice-points*
;; 2/9/07 Added *SDM&P*. 7/27 moved collections ahead of amounts and numbers.
;; 10/5/09 Moved in [tree-families;correspondences] because it has to be after most
;; if not all of the grammar has been loaded. 6/19/10 added Porter-stemmer.
;; 11/12/10 Removed *poirot* since that code's being revamped and redistributed
;; and we don't have rights to its source anyway. Added mumble-interface next to
;; correspondences. 7/10/11 Added hook for the generic lexicon with call to setup-
;; comlex. 7/19 added *generic-military*. 8/1 uncommented loading of (very minimal)
;; upper-model so general categories are available earlier. 8/25 Moved collections
;; up just after the upper-model because they had followed location which depended
;; on them to formulate plurals. 9/16 Broke words loader into two parts: loader1
;; and loader-part-2. 9/29 moved 32d part later. 12/16/11 added hurricanes.
;; 12/3/12 Removed bracket files to their own loader. 3/18/13 added 2d-loader
;; for kinds.  Also bumped title loader to 3.  7/1/13 Added a post-loader for adjunct
;; rules. 12/2/13 waypoints. 1/29/14 Removing the *c3* guards to see if everything
;; will load compatibly. 3/28/14 converted loading kinds;upper-model to kinds;1st-loader
;; so that file could be broken into more useful pieces. 4/16/14 moved it just below
;; collections so plural realizations would work. 5/25/14 added a call to make temporal
;; sequences among the final operations after dossiers are loaded. 6/1/14 added
;; more temporal bits that late. 6/4/14 Removed NIH. 6/15/14 Adding more grammar
;; module gates so we get a better tally of who many words, etc. we have. 12/10/14
;; moved 1st-kinds in front of collections, which led to adjustments in the construction
;; of plurals for the lemmas in 1st-kinds. 1/30/15 had to change conditionalization
;; on situation to get text structure to load.
