;;;     File:  "master-loader"
;;;   module:  "init;versions:v2.7:loaders:"
;;;  Version:   March 2011

;; 4/21  added loading of chart-drivers;new:loader
;; 4/25  split fsas into basics and model
;; 7/15  tweeked the separation of the grammar
;; 8/8  (v1.9) bumped init-drivers to 5.
;; 9/15 (v1.9) Added guarded calls for joint ventures and
;;      the AssetNet interface
;;      -- and bumped the loader for syntax; to 1 to protect the old
;;      conjunction routine.
;; 9/17 (v1.9) bumped pronouns; loader to 1
;; 10/2 (v1.9) added loading of core;amounts
;; 10/19 (v2.0) added traversal-routines
;; 10/21 bumped [rule links:object] to 2. 10/22 added objects;labels.
;; 10/23 added SGML;loader
;; 10/30 moved the abbreviations to workspace
;; 10/31 sharpened tokenizer driving
;; 11/4  added the workspace files
;; 11/28 broke psp;finish into complete and referent
;; 12/2 moved individuals from dossiers to objects;model
;; 2/6/92 bumped drivers;inits to 6.
;; 2/9 switched how assetnet was gated to just *assetnet*
;; 3/19 added corpus;
;; (5/15 v2.2) bumped sgml to 1
;; 5/21 pulled words:basics:sections from the load as irrelevant
;; (7/13 v2.3) added the cons resource under tools.  Bumped drivers;inits loader
;;   to 7.  Bumped [do CA] to 1, [pronouns] -> 2, [rules;CA] -> 1, 
;;   [complete] to 1
;; ...
;; (5/11/93) bumped analysers;forest:loader to 1, bumped drivers;chart:psp:
;;   loader to 5
;; (6/2) rearranged the order of some files in the grammar
;; (6/4) added "model:core:category-preferences"
;; (7/16) repackaged things like Plist-for into objects;chart:generics
;; (8/16) gated the definition of Load-the-grammar so that a parser-only
;;  version wouldn't see function calls that weren't going to be defined
;;  Also moved files around to minimize temporarily undef. funs.
;; (8/18) divided the traces loader
;; (8/24) edited workspace calls so they could be compiled
;; (9/10) moved the workspace from init to individual versions so they
;;  could be easily specialized.
;; (9/13) added an explicit call to initialize-cons-resource,
;; (9/21) added the adjuncts at the top of the core grammar
;; (9/27) moved [traversal] up to drivers;chart and a direct call rather than
;;  being part of psp
;; (12/7) added loading of the Sparser-drivers in [corpus;]
;; (12/27) added [grammar:rules:sources:loader] and moved the orthography
;;  parts of gr. to the end, deleted an extra loading of sect. code. Added
;;  [drivers;articles], which was apparently missing before this.
;; (1/14/94) moved traces;online hook from  traces;ops-loader to drivers
;; (1/17) added [autodef tableau]. (3/5) shielded gmod-menu creation from 
;; the backup routine, changed the corpus loader to use Namelist-to-string
;; rather than the Mac-specific version
;; (3/28) moved [FSAs:loader - model1] back inside Load-the-grammar, added
;; loading of analyzers & grammar;rules DM&P.  3/30 reflected shift in position
;; of the corpus sparser-drivers to interface.  4/1 bumped names loader to 2
;; 4/13 put a gate on the tree families.  4/19 broke out load-the-grammar to
;; its own file. Added a dummy function here for meta-point
;; 5/27 added gated loading of interface for Apple.  8/93 moved a few loadpoints
;; around to settle conflicts; bumped session-inits;setup to 3
;; 10/31 added DA in objects and drivers.  12/12 added *sun* check at the end
;; with the applications.  3/16/95 tweeking some logicals to provide for
;; public grammar.  9/22 switched the order of interface; workbench and 
;; grammar since a grammar file refers to an autodef.  10/3 added loaders for
;; scan-level-patterns  12/1 added [line count]   6/5/96 added gate for delayed
;; loading of the grammar. 8/17/97 added gate on citations.  10/11/97 converted
;; grammar calls over to gload.  11/29 added parameterizations on *lattice-point*
;; 2/26/98 Added it to referent. 9/12 added annotation within psi.
;; 4/29/00 bumped check to loader1 for composite referents. 4/27/03 added loader
;; for objects;export.
;; 1/6-7/07 Moved the scope of *nothing-Mac-specific* up to cover most of the
;; workbench because Allegro doesn't recognize MCL's character macro for points.
;; 2/9/07 Added *SDM&P* 4/8/09 Added alternative load in drivers;DA when the
;; *da* module isn't included.  8/27 Added objects/import/.
