;; Broken out of scan1 2/28/13. 3/13/13 added word-to-left-of-head,
;; edge-to-left-of-head. Coping with polyword at end of segment 3/14.
;; Generalizing that notion 3/28/13. Fixed edge-over-segment-prefix
;; to notice multiple-edges case. 9/21/13 trivial doc, checks.
;; 8/28/14 Made head-word-of-segment correctly return the positions
;; as well as the word. 
;;RJB 12/13/2014 fixed edge-over-segment-suffix to handle case where last edge is a parenthetical -- which has no
;; referent at the moment, and probably should not act like the head of the segment created by sdm-span-segment
;; in any case
