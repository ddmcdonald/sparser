#|  
  The point of this body of code is to heuristically fill in
anything inside a segment that the parser doesn't. It's also
a site for making general observations about adjacency and
modification facts in aid of getting a better picture of
what the phrase denotes.

  It's calls from segment-finished within the PTS code in
drivers/chart/psp/pts[#].lisp after it has invoked the parser
to make any semantic or form edges that the grammar dictates.
