#| This designed for use with a setup like Grok where we are incorporating
otherwise unknown (unconceptualized) words from some lexical store 
and defining standard-design categories and terminal rules for them.
  The result is that we often have a category as the referent of
a segment edge when we really should have an instance. This code looks 
for situations where that's likely to be the case and creates the appropriate
individuals as needed. It then continues into ordinary operations accordign
to the value of the viable after-action flag for segments.
