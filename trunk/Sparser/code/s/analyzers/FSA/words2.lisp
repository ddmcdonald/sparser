;;;  Version:  2.2 February 2007

;; 5/5/93 v2.3, typed in hard copy of 11/24/92 that had been lost in
;;  disk crash
;; 1.1 (5/15) moved out the default to Consider-capitalization
;;     (8/17) fixed bug of unguarded return value
;; 2.0 (12/7) reworked the threading so that known marked-capitalization case
;;      would get priority. 12/13 cont. to allow entry-points that don't consider
;;      unknown words.  12/29 added traces.
;; 2.1 (1/25/94) presumption that the existence of a caps variant ipso facto
;;      meant it was known proved false.
;; 2.2 (2/26) fixed a presumption about the existence of an rs when the call
;;      started in PFWPNF.
;;     (4/4) fixed a missing path in that entry point whereby it was ignoring
;;      capitalized variants, and wrote Subsuming-variant
;;     (5/5) moved subsuming-variant to [words;lookup:capitalization] and
;;      put in sugared call to set position status
;;     (8/9/95) put nil check on rs into Check-known-word-for-word-fsas
;;     (2/4/07) added push-fsa-onto-word
