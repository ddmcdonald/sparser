;;  initated ~6/90
;;  1.1  (12/90) Added a call to zero-lookup-buffer when the end-of-stream is
;;       reached so that the last "word" passed from there through
;;       Next-token won't cause *display-word-stream*'s trace to duplicate
;;       the penultimate token.
;;  3.0  (9/15/92 v2.3) utterly changed
;;  3.1  (9/8/93) Added a check against word buffer length to Finish token
;;  3.2  (5/31/96) extended the character array to 256 but with only a few
;;        entries, so a check has been added for the entry having a value and
;;        if not it calls a break with an explanation of what to do.
;;       (1/30/13) continue-token got an char entry of 0 on a bad character
;;        so added check for that case to improve the error. 
;;  3.3  (2/3/14) Added check and dispatch for character above 256.
;;       (2/27/14) cleaned up the no-entry logic in continue-token
;;  3.4  (3/2/14) Folded in the common function character-entry to replace
;;        the open-coded versions.
;; 6/5/2015 modified code in run-token-fsas to make it easier 
;;  to find out what characters are causing problems
