;; initiated 9/21/92 v2.3
;; (4/20/93) added Set-tokenizer-table-entry
;; (8/20) finished it.
;; 0.1 (12/2) Removed the range checks from the set function as meaningless
;;      and fixed a bug
;;     (6/9/94) added character-type predicates.
;; 0.2 (5/31/96) Increased the size of the array to 256.
