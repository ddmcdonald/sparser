  ;; Called from determiner-completion-heuristic as an alternative to
  ;; its processing if the debris analysis flag is up.
  ;;    We return an edge if we can make something of this segment,
  ;; otherwise nil, and the default at the level of pts will put
  ;; a segment-label on the edge.
  ;;
  ;;   We're at the end of segment-level analysis. We put an edge over
  ;; this segment like the HA routine would have, but we also do more
  ;; analysis of the segment (given its prefix) so that we can impose
  ;; a semantic analysis on the segment's head and classifiers.
