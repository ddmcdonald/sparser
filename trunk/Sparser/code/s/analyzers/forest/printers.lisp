;; initiated 11/90
;; 0.1 (6/30/91 v1.8.1) Revised TTs to appreciate the possibility of the
;;      chart wrapping.
;; 0.2 (7/22 v1.8.6) Fixed an off-by-one bug in TTs when the chart
;;      is wrapped.
;; (6/19/92) added polywords case to etypecase
;; (6/26) fixed the way words print to get the symbol-based ones right
;; (9/3 v2.3) added case for referential-categories
;; 0.3 (6/4/93) Added a better display of multiple edges over a
;;      single span and got it to print End-of-source
;; 0.4 (12/13) changed increment on *first-chart-position* to 2 from 1 in the
;;      case where the chart has overflowed.   (7/12/94) added mixin-category
;; 0.5 (7/14) added segment printer. 7/18 added cases to it.  8/16 tweeked
;;      synchronization entry point.
;; 0.6 (8/22) parameterizing what's used as the segment printer and enabling tts
;; 0.7 (8/25/04) tweeking simple segment printer as per Scott's wishes.
;;     (5/28/12) added *readout-segments-inline-with-text*  along with the
;;      printer print-segment-and-pending-out-of-segment-words that it gates
;;      and their state variables. 10/10/12 Completely rewrote it
;;     (2/11/13) changed the init form for where print-segment left off
;;      so that it doesn't re-initalize when we're doing a stream of documents.
;;     (3/8/13) Fixed initialization problem with the init form for
;;      *where-print-segment-left-off*. 3/14 added print-treetop-labels-in-segment
;;      3/18 added tts-form and tts-ref. 8/16/13 Added display-bracketing
;;      1/27/14 added undisplay-bracketing
;;     (7/24/14) added print-flat-forest as another tool for looking at debris
;;      7/30/14 tweaked some to use edge-vectors for the :multiple-edges case.
;;     (11/17/14) shrank the separation in tts from 30 to 20. 15 doesn't look
;;      to bad. 
;; 1/10/2015 method (edge-string ...) possibly redundant, for getting a string with  the edge numer, category and input string covered by and edge
;; 3/21/2015 fix error caught by SBCL in print-multiple-edges-tt
