;;;   Version:   0.3 June 1995

;; 0.1 (6/13/93 v2.3) changed the definition of Edge-{starting/ending}-at
;;      and marked the rest as not necessarily in use now
;;     (12/27) added routine to see if there's a treetop of a given category
;;      within a region.
;;     (1/21/94) wrote Sibling-to-the-right
;; 0.2 (3/15) flushed the change of 6/13 since it was blocking the HA routines
;;      whenever there were multiple edges.
;;     (3/28) wrote Word-before-pos
;; 0.3 (6/9) added flag to Find-tt.. to inhibit it returning the parent edge
;;      and wrote Second-highest-tt-starting-at
;;     (6/13/95) fixed probable bug in Rightmost-daughter-edge
