;;;   Version:   1.5 October 2014

;; 1.1  (2/8/91 v1.8.1) added Final-tt/category
;; 1.2  (2/13 v1.8.1) Modified ...-treetop-at to both return words if there
;;      isn't a top edge.
;; 1.3  (3/19 v1.8.1)  Wrote Treetop? predicate
;; 1.4  (4/26 v1.8.4)  Added Next-treetop/rightward
;;      (7/25/94 v2.3) added Number-of-treetops-between
;;      (7/27) added {Right,Left}-treetop-at/edge variation
;; 1.5  (9/28) fixed bug in left-treetop-at/edge. (10/26) added doc.
;;      (12/1) added Treetops-between
;;      (1/2/96) added a variation that only returns edges
;;      (9/8/14) Converted a few functions to methods taking edges.
;;      (10/7/14) reorderd and notice redundancies to flush at some point
;;      (1/2/2015) key component of whack-a-rule control structure -- find all applicable rules across adjacent treetops
;;       called repeatedly, getting different rules each time as the tretops change by application of rules
;; 1/4/2015 add flag and bind the special *left-edge-into-reference* in possible-treetop-=rules so that ref/function can work as a predicate
;; 1/6/2015 new mechanism in whack-a-rule to prioritize PP creation and attachemnt above subject+verb binding
