;;;   Version:   1.5 May 2015

;; 1.1  (2/8/91 v1.8.1) added Final-tt/category
;; 1.2  (2/13 v1.8.1) Modified ...-treetop-at to both return words if there
;;      isn't a top edge.
;; 1.3  (3/19 v1.8.1)  Wrote Treetop? predicate
;; 1.4  (4/26 v1.8.4)  Added Next-treetop/rightward
;;      (7/25/94 v2.3) added Number-of-treetops-between
;;      (7/27) added {Right,Left}-treetop-at/edge variation
;; 1.5  (9/28) fixed bug in left-treetop-at/edge. (10/26) added doc.
;;      (12/1) added Treetops-between
;;      (1/2/96) added a variation that only returns edges
;;      (9/8/14) Converted a few functions to methods taking edges.
;;      (10/7/14) reorderd and notice redundancies to flush at some point
;;      (1/2/2015) key component of whack-a-rule control structure -- find all applicable rules across adjacent treetops
;;       called repeatedly, getting different rules each time as the tretops change by application of rules
;; 1/4/2015 add flag and bind the special *left-edge-into-reference* in possible-treetop-=rules so that ref/function can work as a predicate
;; 1/6/2015 new mechanism in whack-a-rule to prioritize PP creation and attachemnt above subject+verb binding
;; 1/8/2015 refactor possible-treetop-rules to make it easier to trace and understand
;; 1/8/2015 rename to best-treetop-rule and make it return one rule only
;; 1/14/2015 revise losing-competition? to account for more general form of subject rule, looking at cfr-rule-forms
;; 1/18/2015 fix typo in test-subcat-rule
;; 2/10/15 cleaned up / reformatted a bit so I could figure out what's
;;  going on in the code that supports whack-a-rule
;; 3/4/2015 correct spelling of *use-broader-set-of-tts*, and replace "wack" with "whack"
;; cache rules discovered for pairs of edges so that we do not keep calling multiply-edges unnecessarily
;; 5/1/2015 minor tweak on losing-competition?  to do better on leftwards extension of NPs which may be SUBJECTs
;; 5/12/2015 fixes to losing-competition? to better handle leftwards extension of NP subjects before they are used as subjects
;; 5/15/15 Moved out literal-edge? to the edge object code.
;; 5/25/2015 add on check on competition for pp-wh-pronoun as part of pp-relative-clause
;; 5/30/2015 handle new cases of vp_passive in rule competition
;; 6/2/2015 major cleanup in losing-competition?, which led to the discoverhy of some omitted cases in the final check
;; this allowed it to work in the case of the Chen/Sorger sentences...
