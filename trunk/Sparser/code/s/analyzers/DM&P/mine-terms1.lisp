;; split out from [analyzers;DM&P:mine] 8/3/94 v2.3.  Being tweeked
;; continually ... 
;; 1.0 (8/4) changed category policy for terms
;; 1.1 (11/21) stopped recording head and classifier data on the segment now that
;;      they're being phased out.
;;     (11/26) made Mine-verb use a real verb-building routine
;; 1.2 (12/1) Tweeked Mine-unmarked-term to pass through the form data, and
;;      added Mine-adverb
;;     (1/3/95) added Mine-unmarked-term-under-edge as better sugar for that case

#|  These routines process single words (or polywords).  If the word
 hasn't been seen before they have a term created for it with as
 much specificity as the segment-context permits, and they have
 an edge introduced to span the word so that the term is entered
 into the discourse history.  The term is returned to the caller.

    If the word has already been seen, then there will already be
 an edge spanning it -- the edge produced by the rule that was
 created when its term way -- and we just return the edge's referent.
