;;;   version:  0.3 July 1995

;; initiated 3/28/94 v2.3.  Broken out into two level dispatch 7/11
;; 7/27 gated the segment printing. 8/15 Tweeked the control on the trace
;; 8/16,19 added an abort capacity to get through cases where an error
;; was going to occur.
;; 0.1 (12/5) added hook for reanalyzing segments that are too long
;; 0.2 (2/13/95) refashioned dm/Dispatch-on-segment-coverage to provide
;;      an entry point that isn't knit into the mainline.
;; 0.3 (7/12) added a case to the dispatch to bring it uptodate and redid how
;;      the 'restart' flag is managed.
