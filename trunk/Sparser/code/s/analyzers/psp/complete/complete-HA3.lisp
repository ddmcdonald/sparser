;;;   Version:   3.5 July 2008

;; 3.1 (5/3/93) added status setting to word completion routine
;; 3.2 (6/11) passed positions through to next stage
;; 3.3 (12/6) flushed the polyword case since it's subsumed by edges
;; 3.4 (6/6/94) added a optional subsumption test on edges
;; 3.5 (7/12) redefined the subsumption test as an alist to handle arbitrary depth
;;     (7/22) put a patch in it to get around a separate bug
;;     (10/13/97) put a model gate in Complete-edge/hugin.
;;     (2/5/07) converted e{type}case to use otherwise & break
;;     (7/14/08) Made "hugin" lowercase in anticipation of lower-casing
;;      all functions.
