;; 5.0 (9/28/92 v2.3) accomodating changes to the tokenizer
;; 5.1 (4/9/93) flushed references to word package - used constants instead
;; 5.2 (1/13/94) added reset of *first-chart-position* to 2 on wrap
;; 5.3 (5/3) added passing through of position to writing routines
;;     (6/3) added Next-chart-position-to-fill
;; 5.4 (12/12) moved binding point of 'word' after the wrapping-check so that
;;      the correct *next-array-position-to-fill* is available to next-terminal.
