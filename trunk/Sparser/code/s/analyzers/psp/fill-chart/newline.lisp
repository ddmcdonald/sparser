;;;  Version:  0.8 February 2010

;; initiated 8/91 v1.2
;; (11/1 v2.0.1) Reordered the clauses by their frequency of occurance
;; 0.1 (6/26/92 v2.2) Changed the values checked to fit conventions for
;;      paragraph as a section-marker
;; 0.2 (11/28 v2.3) added default binding for sm-paragraph-start
;; 0.3 (4/9/93) flushed references to word package - used constants instead
;;      Moved sm-paragraph-start to rules:words:required
;; 0.4 (4/20/94) moved in all the basic setup from NL fsas that had been in 
;;      in the version stored in the grammar
;; 0.5 (5/2) made the display of whitespace returned from the NL fsa be literally
;;      the word rather than what's in the buffer
;; 0.6 (12/13) Added a call to reset the line adjustment counter when a
;;      newline is returned and it is treated as whitespace. 
;; 0.7 (1/15/96) added another case specifically looking for the paragraph start
;;      word so that it could direct bump-&-store-word not to look into the buffer
;;      for what to print. 
;; 0.8 (6/18) added a case for sentence boundaries.
;;     (8/17/97) moved in *count-input-lines*
;;     (2/22/10) Somewhere along the line the newline fsa got an argument but
;;     the "not defined" hadn't been update to match.
;;     (11/10/10) fixed problem compiler identified
