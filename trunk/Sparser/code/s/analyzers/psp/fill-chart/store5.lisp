;;1.1  (1/4/91 v1.7)  Moved the point of the trace so it could report
;;     character start indicies as well.  Added clearing the preceding
;;     whitespace field.
;;1.2  (1/14 v1.7)  Changed the calculation of the character index to
;;     include the amount accumulated in prior fillings of the character
;;     buffer.  This had been done only in Setup as part of reading
;;     an edge out (and thereby doing it at a lesser frequency -- now
;;     its being done all the time), but that led to a fencepost error
;;     when the buffer was refilled (bumping the accumulation) after the
;;     position was filled but before an edge referring to that position
;;     was read out.
;; 1.3 (6/30 v1.8.6) Added *first-chart-position-object*
;; 1.4 (1/14/92 v2.2)  moved in *display-word-stream*
;;     (1/15) added initialization of the capitalization field
;; 4.0 (9/28 v2.3) accomodates extensive changes to tokenizer
;; 4.1 (11/25) changed it to clear one position beyond the next position
;;     (12/15) fixed a bug in that change
;; 4.2 (11/12/93) the calculation of the char-index was wacko
;; 4.3 (1/21/94) tweeked the chart-index again using a value that gets
;;      subtracted to keep the record in sync with what's displayed
;; 4.4 (5/2) and again with a value to be added
;; 4.5 (5/3) Passing position to write routine to get display data
;; 4.6 (8/29) added call to keep discourse-history clean w.r.t. the Workbench
;;     (1/14/96) made that call unconditional. 1/15 added a keyword so that
;;     it prints the word it is passed rather than what's in the buffer. 
;;     1/16 tweeking call to long-term-ify

  "Some characters appear in the buffer but are not printed.
     The prime example is the linefeed that follows newlines in
   Dow Jones' DJNS version of the Wall Street Journal. It is caught

     We have to keep the indexes that are stored on the positions
   in sync with what's displayed, hence this counter.")

   newline characters added by the adjustment process. That is a
