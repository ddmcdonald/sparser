;;;  version:  1.0 December 2014

;; Broken out from driver 2/5/13. This code was developed with some
;; difficulty and confusion for the JTC/TRS project. Throwing out most
;; of it and reconstruing these results as names. 
;; 0.4 2/25/14 Modified to retain the interior punctuation.
;; 0.5 7/28/14 Turned parse-between-boundaries back on for "Ser1507"
;;     8/7/14 Debugged edge case (EOS) in sentence-final-punctuation-pattern?
;; 0.6 9/9/14 refactoring to make management simpler.
;; 0.7 10/9/14 Added scare quotes, debugged edge cases. 
;; 1.0 11/18/14 Bumped number to permit major revamp to fit into multi-
;;   pass scanning. 12/4/14 moved out the patterns to their own file.
