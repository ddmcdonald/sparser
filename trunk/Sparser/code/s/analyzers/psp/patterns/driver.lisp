;; initiated 9/21/95. Fleshed out 10/5. 
;; 0.1 (7/12/96) Substantially revised, and its state maintainance was buggy. 
;; 0.2 (3/1/07) Wrote a new scheme that groups no-space sequences into single
;;      word-based edges without paying attention to patterns.
;; 0.3 (2/5/13) striped out the one-or-the-other design of the driver of
;;      the scan. Broke out the simpler scheme to its own file.
