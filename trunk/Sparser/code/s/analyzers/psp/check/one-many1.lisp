;; 0.0 (9/4/92 v2.3) broken out from drivers;chart:psp
;; 1.0 (5/15/93) took out the constraint about not changing the category
;;      of a right-boundary edge within a segment.  Make it the driver's
;;      problem.  Since the edge-construction trace is with the edge code,
;;      that pretty much gutted the routine.
;;     (3/16/94) Added a version that just checked.
;; 1.1 (3/8/13) Gating the trap for multiple single-term edges completing.
;;      Happened will stress testing against the whole treebank, so this
;;      isn't unreasonable
;;     (1/13/15) Blocked consideration of literals in check-one-many
