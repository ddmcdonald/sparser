;; 0.0 (9/4/92 v2.3) broken out from drivers;chart:psp
;;     (5/14/93) renamed a routine
;; 1.0 (5/15/93) took out the constraint about not changing the category
;;      of a right-boundary edge within a segment.  Make it the driver's
;;      problem.  Since the edge-construction trace is with the edge code,
;;      that pretty much gutted the routine.
;; 1.1 (10/13/95) added check against dotted-rules when two come up.
