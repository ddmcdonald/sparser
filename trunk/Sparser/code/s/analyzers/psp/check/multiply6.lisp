;;;  Version:  6.0 August 2008

;; 0.0 (9/4/92 v2.3) initiated.
;; 0.1 (10/12) pulled multiply-ids back to [chart;edges:multiplication],
;;      and extensively revised it to handle all the cases in form rules.
;;     (10/14) fixed some unforseen cases
;;     (12/16) adding a trace msg to a case that was missed
;; 0.2 (6/13/94) added check for right-edge being dotted
;; 2.0 (7/12) completely rewrote the threading essentially from scratch
;; 3.0 (9/28) fixed substantial case-gap in that
;;     (12/29) added more traces
;; 3.1 (12/30) added Check-form-form and its threading
;; 4.0 (2/29/00) Incorporating checks against composite referents. 6/17 got
;;      one case working.
;; 5.0 (2/9/05) Revising/streamlining the checkes. Reconsidering whether 'composite'
;;      is the right structure to work against.
;; 6.0 (8/17/07) Adding additional cases to allow category-id checks against
;;      edges' form labels. Motivated by (new) DN&P operations where the
;;      form label provides the needed context/generality: "three swans".
;;     (8/28/08) When we do that, we get an interaction with n-ary rules
;;      where the form field holds a symbol (:dotted-intermediary). Those
;;      don't combine, so we just let category-ids return nil.
