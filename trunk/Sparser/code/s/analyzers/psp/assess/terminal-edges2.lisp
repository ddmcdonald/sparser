;;;   Module:  "analyzers;psp:assess:"
;;;  Version:  2.7 February 2011

;; initiated 9/12 v2.3
;; 1.1 (10/23) reorganized what kinds of property edges are created
;;      given the explicit marking of character properties in the positions
;;      and the changes to where fsa are triggered.
;; 1.2 (11/23) drastically reorganized everything to install sensitivity to
;;      case in what rules are instantiated.
;; 1.3 (4/23/93) added a status mark on the position
;; 1.4 (5/11) moved morphology-based edges into grammar;rules:syntax
;; 1.5 (5/14) finished a stub
;; 2.0 (5/22) bumped it to preserve the old version of the core routine
;;      Preterminals/word to allow recovery from drastic change to how to
;;      interpret literals and the single-term-rewrite field
;;     (9/14) added traces, ditto (9/16)
;; 2.1 (1/25/94) presumption that the existence of a caps variant ipso facto
;;      meant it was known proved false.
;; 2.2 (3/15) tweeked creation process for literals to retain more information
;;      and reordered literals before single-term rewrites
;;     (5/5) put in sugared call to set position status
;; 2.3 (5/23) an additional level of parens were being put on morph-edges
;; 2.4 (7/18) added a rule that you can't introduce terminal edges over a word
;;      that has already been spanned -- comes up in hacking angle-bracketed
;;      section-markers. 
;; 2.5 (7/25) refined cases of edges over unknowns re. affixes
;; 2.6 (5/22/95) modified Known-preterminals/check-caps to go back to the lowercase
;;      if the variants don't yield edges
;; 2/7 (2/20/11) Refined control of creation of digit edges in preterminals-
;;      for-unknown with *make-edges-over-new-digit-sequences*.
