;;;   Version:   1.3 September 2014

;; 1.0 (9/7/92 v2.3) flushed out of date field references
;; 1.1 (2/24/94) added daughter and used-in encoding
;; 1.2 (3/30) changed daughter-collecting call to 'all-treetops'
;;     (8/30/95) moved the used-in after complete
;;     (1/9/13) Added constituents and words keywords to let those
;;      fields on the edge to be populated when the caller
;;      has them in its hand. 
;; 1.3 (9/25/14) switched to using successive-treetop because
;;      of a bug found in the multiple-edge case of all-treetops,
;;      though even that is uneven about choice among multiple edges
;;      so added semi-redundant set-used-by when constituents are known.

;; 5/25/2015 added call to place-referent-in-lattice around computation of edge-referent field
;;  initial work to produce a lattice of descriptions
;;  the places where this call is put were determined by the methods where (complete edge) was also called
