;;;   Version:   1.0 September 1994

;; initiated in August 1990
;; 0.1 (3/5/91  v1.8.1)  Changed the return value of Make-default-binary-edge
;;      to be Nil if the edge was aborted by the referent calculation.
;;     (3/8/93 v2.3) added a trace message
;; 0.2 (4/7) Added a check for a null ev on the left-edge, indicating that
;;      the chart wrapped and we're consuming edges still in use.
;; 0.3 (5/15) pulled the capacity for the reference calculation to abort the edge
;; 1.0 (9/6/94) put it back in
