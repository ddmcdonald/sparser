;;;   Version:   1.0 May 2015

;; initiated in May 2015
;; Code to place referents in a description lattice to facilitate anaphora and other reasoning
;; 5/30/2015 added a bunch more functionality to description (not-yet-quite-a)lattice
;; 6/20.2015 substantial cleanup for this file -- revised data structures and methods
;; still need to deal with implied superc and subc links
;; First test on compare-to-snapshots d=generated many more elements in the lattice than I would have expected
;; set *no-description-lattice* to have this called when parsing
;; 7/7/2015 Maintain the indiv-restrictions field, which contains a list of all the immediate superior referential categories 
;; (1 in most cases, but can be more than on for a join) and all of the dli-vvâ€™s which have been produced
;; by the set of bind-variable operations that defined this individual.
;; added predicate more-specific? which tests relative position (subsumption) in the description lattice
