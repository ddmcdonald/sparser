;; created 9/1/11. 10/3 Adapting to getting categories as arguments, e.g.
;; in the case of prepositions. 11/8/12 Adjusted argument order to match
;; order in the rule. 1/18/13 Removed the block from *grok* so it would
;; actually run. Cleaned up. 7/1/13 Added def-k-method as syntactic sugar
;; to hide the uglyness. 7/21/13 Refactored to set a method-setup that
;; can be used independently of referent specifications and moved them
;; out to the rest of that machinery. 8/22/13 Put in a check so methods
;; aren't applied to words.
