;;;   Version:   2.2 July 2013

;; initiated 12/91
;; 1.0 (7/17/92 v2.3) added :instantiate-individual-with-binding
;; 1.1 (10/24) flushed the out-of-date referent actions and added some
;;      cases in the new semantics
;; 1.2 (12/31) expanded number of arguments 'function' option can take
;; 1.3 (6/4/93) tweeked the way binding arguments are passed on
;; 1.4 (6/15) put in ugly special case to smooth over inconsistency in the
;;      packaging of "binding" by rdata and others.
;; 2.0 (3/22/98) Put in machinery to record annotations on lattice-points.
;; 2.1 (6/30) moved the annotator up out of here.
;; 2.2 (5/10/11) Redesign staging of annotation of the whole rule ('pair')
;;      for the :bindings case.
;;     (9/1/11) Added dispatch for :method. 9/26/11 Fixed case where bindings
;;      call to annotate presumed it had a psi and got an individual instead
;;     (7/21/13) Consolidated globals to driver
