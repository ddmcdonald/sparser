;;;   Version:   2.4 July 2013

;; broken out from all-in-one-file 11/28/91
;; 1.0 (8/28/92 v2.3) Added global referring to the referent returned.
;; 1.1 (10/24) flushed the out-of-date referent actions and added some
;;      cases in the new semantics
;; 1.2 (5/15/93) Switched to setq'ing *referent* because the actions have
;;      to change it.
;; 1.3 (8/4) added keyword args so that it could be driven off referents
;;      directly without having to have the left-edge.
;; 1.4 (1/6/94) added switch that would pre-empt everything
;; 1.5 (4/19/95) zero'ing *referent* at the start of each call.
;; 2.0 (3/22/98) direct referents now initiate psi's.
;;     (6/30) rethreaded to group common elements as part of handling annotations.
;;     (7/12) pulled them in favor of doing within the dispatches.
;; 2.1 (7/25) Because the psi keep going down the lattice as they get elaborated,
;;      changed to updating the referent with each action instead of just
;;      the first.
;; 2.2 (6/4/99) revised Referent-from-rule to pass more information through to
;;      the annotater, and cleaned up the now obsolete direct-pointer?
;; 2.3 (1/10/07) Refined decision for 2.1 so that only certain classes update
;;      the referent (cases from dm&p rules)
;;     (4/27/11) Cleanup. More on 5/10
;; 2.4 (7/22/13) Added some doc and the base of the redistribute method
