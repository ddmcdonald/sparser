;;;   Version:   3.1 June 2014

;; broken out as its own file 11/91
;; 1.0 (10/23/92 v2.3) Got the options set up to date with actions in
;;      the new semantics.
;; 1.1 (12/31) added function and daughter options
;; 1.2 (5/14/93) fixed the bug in the daughter option
;; 1.3 (6/3) revised the arguments that ref/head is called with
;;     (6/17) ditto for ref/sub-type.
;;     (10/19/97) Referent-from-unary-rule choked on a symbol where it expected
;;      a rule, so put a gate on that.
;; 2.0 (3/22/98) direct referents now initiate psi's.
;;     (4/23) binding *rule-being-interpreted*
;;     (6/30) reworked how annotations were integrated and rethreaded.
;;     (6/4/99) Added an argument to the call to Annotate-individual from
;;       Referent-from-unary-rule.
;;     (4/19/00) Rationalized the annotation policy coming out of the
;;      driver to do it at that level only in the case of direct pointers
;;      and otherwise insist that the actions do it.
;; 2.1 (6/21) changed the arguments to annotate-realization/base-case. It had
;;      passed the rule as the second arg. and now passes what the caller expects.
;;     (12/26) added flag argument to :head case of dispatch for benefit of annotation
;; 2.2 (2/2/05) Removing the annotation calls for the nonce, e.g. Referent-from-unary-rule
;; 2.1 (3/20) Put it back unchanged.
;;     (10/31/06) put in 'get through' for mixin referents as with "will" in
;;       mixin-category.
;;     (2/6/07) Removed an ecase.
;; 3.0 (7/22/09) fanout from changes in psi design. (9/1) Added exception for
;;      external referents into referent-from-unary-rule. Added notes 11/12/12
;; 3.1 (10/10/13) Added final hook to incorporate the referent into the situation. 
;;     (5/30/14 Fixed long-standing bug in funcall cases.  (6/4/13) Added instantiate
;;     case to the dispatch.
