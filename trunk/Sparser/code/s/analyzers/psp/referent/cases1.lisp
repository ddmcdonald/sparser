;;;   Version:  1.9 April 2015

;; (2/27/92 v2.2) fixed a bug in Ref/composite where it was offset
;;   by one when extracting a literal from the rule's referent field
;; 1.0 (7/17/92 v2.3) added :instantiate-individual-with-binding, and
;;      switched to categories from gl.
;; 1.1 (8/28) Reworked the binding case to fit current dogma rather than the
;;      original (12/91) treatment.
;; 1.2 (10/24) flushed the out-of-date referent actions and added some
;;      cases in the new semantics.
;; 1.3 (12/31) expanded number of arguments 'function' option can take
;; 1.4 (6/3/93) tweeked ref/head to do referential-categories, and again
;;      on 6/10 to do individuals
;;     (6/20) patched over ref/binding for inconsistency in packaging
;;      between rdata and cfrs
;; 1.5 (7/8) changed data-checks in ref/binding to distinguish badly threaded
;;      calls from null variable values
;; 1.6 (8/24) broke out the cases for the new semantics.
;; 1.7 (2/14/05) Removed annotation call from Ref/function.
;; 1.8 (5/17/11) Putting it back. 5/26/12 it needs an additional
;;      lattice-point argument now, but blocked case of keywords that
;;      indicate no value, so postposing looking it up.
;;     (9/25/14) Better error msg if ref-form is bad in ref/daughter
;; 1.9 (11/7/14) let ref/function take three arguments. 
;;     (4/19/15) Added ref/handle-head-and-bindngs.
;; 5/30/2015 do necessary copy (for Descritption Lattice) in ef/handle-head-and-bindngs

;;; bindings on established head
;;;------------------------------
#| The current version of ref/head make a new individual every time
the head is a referential-category (using make-individual-for-dm&p).
There's a note questioning it, but to do the right thing, which would
be a find-or-make, we need access to the bindings in the way that
:instantiate-individual-with-binding has. A temporary check and 
rearrangement in walk-through-referent-actions put this together.
Once it's been shaken down that should move to the regular referent
construction code.
