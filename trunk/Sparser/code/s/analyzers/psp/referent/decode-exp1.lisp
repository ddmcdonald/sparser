;;;   Version:   1.10 August 2011

;; initiated 12/91
;; 1.1 (7/17/92 v2.3) Revising details to fit new representation scheme
;; 1.2 (9/3) Changed the :bind to a :with in :instantiate-individual
;; 1.3 (10/24) flushed the out-of-date referent actions and added some
;;      cases in the new semantics.
;; 1.4 (12/30) Reworking things a bit to get a single, consistent set of
;;      operations for simple (non-Krisp) cases.
;; 1.5 (2/26/93) fixed some misspellings.
;;     (5/15) ditto
;;     (6/1) had left out the case of a symbol by itself being interpreted
;;      as a category in in Def-cfr expressions -- fixed Resolve-referent-
;;      expression.
;; 1.6 (6/3) revised Decode-head to allow a symbol denoting a category
;;      as a possible argument.
;; 1.7 (6/10) revised Decode-head yet again to allow individuals
;; 1.8 (9/19) added "x-edge" cases to the numbered edge names.
;; 1.9 (2/20/01) Modified Resolve-referent-expression to permit categories directly
;;      as well as expressions denoting expressions -- needed for simple treatment
;;      of plurals.
;; 1.10 (6/11/08) Added individuals. Only seems obvious - motivated by quantifiers
;;      (8/31/11) added :method to *toplevel-referent-actions*
;;      (7/24/13) Removed the undefined function warning.
