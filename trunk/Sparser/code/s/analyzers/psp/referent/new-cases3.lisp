;;;   Version:  3.1 March 2011

;; broken out from cases 8/24/93 v2.3.  (3/10/94) fixed typo. Added error
;; msg to Ref/head 6/14.  (7/15) patched in mixin-category  (7/19) rearranged
;; break in Ref/binding ...and again 9/12.
;; 0.1 (4/19/95) defanged Ref/subtype until the proper subtyping regime is done
;; 1.0 (2/26/98) Started rewriting everything to work with lattice points.
;;      Continued sporatically through 7/25.
;;     (3/25/00) Resumed through 6/18.
;; 1.1 (6/18) Added Opportunistic-binding-to-composite-head. Incorporated annotation
;;      into it 6/21. Occasional tweaks through 7/9.
;; 1.2 (12/26) Added optional arg. to ref/head so the annotation call could know
;;      it was coming in from a unary-rule.
;; 2.0 (2/9/05) Removed notion of composite from ref/subtype. More on 2/16.
;; 2.1 (3/16) Changed ref/binding to work on individuals as well as psi
;;     (2/16/07) Added guard on annotating realizations in individuals-with-bindings
;;     (7/6) Added case for mixin-category in Ref/head to handle the edge over
;;      "could". Needs a hook that we don't have to later propagate the modality over
;;      the actual head of the segment. 8/2 Added some traces to help track PSI
;;      creation.
;; 3.0 (7/22/09) fanout from conditionalized psi changes. Continuing through 8/17.
;;     (9/20) Modified ref/subtype to ignore calling the subtype routine unless
;;      *use-subtypes* is set.
;; 3.1 (3/23/11) Refactored dolist over values in ref/instantiate-individual-
;;      with-binding in order to be able to pass an edge to annotate-site-bound-to.
;;     (5/10/11) Fixed gratuitous zero'ing of globals for the edges, setting both
;;      in ref/head

#| Head statements in a referent will always come first. They just
 serve to elevate the referent of one of the daughters to be the
 referent of the phrase were interpreting, or they could be newly
 introducing a referent where more structure is needed in the
 referent expression than just laying down a category or an 
 individual as the direct interpretation -- initial motivation 
 from "companies" 3/25/00.
