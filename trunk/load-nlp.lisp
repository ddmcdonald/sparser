;;;   File:   load-nlp
;;; Version:  May 2014

;; This file will load the language understanding system Sparser, the
;; language generator Mumble, and a shared set of utilities.

;; Part of the system is loaded using ASDF, most is loaded by explicit load
;; files. The common reference point is the location of this file. We
;; collect the location of this file using *load-truename* in step 1.

;; There are other files however that must be given pathnames in this file.
;; The values here now assume that you checked out the system to the
;; directory "sparser" in your home directory (i.e. ~/sparser). If you put
;; it somewhere else then you will need to changed those paths

;; What this file does:
;; 1. Records the location of this file as *nlp-home*
;; 2. Loads ASDF and pushes two file locations onto its registry
;; 3. Load the utilities using asdf 
;; 4. Create the sparser package
;; 5. Load Mumble
;; 6. Choose a specializing script and load Sparser
;; 7. Load the files in Mumble that depend on Sparser.

;; #1 --- set the base directory

(defparameter *nlp-home*
  (make-pathname :directory (pathname-directory *load-truename*)
                 :device (pathname-device *load-truename*)))
;; This is only for by-hand debugging if something goes wrong.
;; Change to fit where you put Sparser
;; (setq *nlp-home* "/Users/ddm/sparser/")


;; #2 --- ASDF setup

;; are in the package :ddm-util, which is also the name of its asd file

;;  and load it.

;; is loaded.
