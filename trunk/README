* How to install & run Sparser *

********************************

Thank you for downloading Sparser. This short guide
will help you get everything up & running in no time.


Installation & Setup
====================

1. Install the root directory "sparser" wherever you like.
We recommend (and the default configuration assumes) that
you keep it in your home directory, e.g., as ~/sparser/.

When you checkout the trunk of the svn distribution to
that root location, it should contain three immediate
subdirectories: "Mumble", "Sparser", and "util", 
as well as this README file and the file load-nlp.lisp.

2. If you installed the "sparser" directory somewhere
other than your home directory, you'll need to modify
the file paths in the "ASDF setup" section of the
"load-nlp.lisp" file to match your configuration.

You are now ready to load Sparser.


Testing Sparser
====================

You need to have a modern implementation of Common Lisp
already installed. Sparser has been primarily tested on 
Intel-based Mac OS X using Clozure (www.clozure.com) and
Allegro (www.franz.com). It will not (yet) run under
SBCL. What happens with other Lisps is not known.

We recommend Clozure because it automatically compiles 
functions as it loads them. If you use Allegro, you will
need to explicitly compile the core of Sparser to avoid
blowing out the stack on text longer than about 30 words,
see sparser/Sparser/init/scripts/compile-everything.lisp.

1. Start Lisp.

2. Load the "sparser/load-nlp.lisp" file. If running
Allegro CL with a default installation, you can do this
with ":ld ~/sparser/load-nlp.lisp".

3. Switch over to the Sparser namespace by executing
"(in-package :sparser)".

4. Test that Sparser is working properly & that it can
parse a simple phrase. Execute "(p "10 days")".

Your output should look something like this:
====================
sparser(3): (p "10 days")
[10 days]

                                 source-start
e3    amount-of-time          1 "10 days" 3
                                 end-of-source
:done-printing
====================

If so, congratulations -- Sparser is working. Check out
the documentation in "~/sparser/Sparser/documentation" to
see how you can start writing your own grammars.
