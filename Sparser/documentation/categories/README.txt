October 23, 2016, revised and extended December 2023

The files in this directory are exhaustive listings of the categories
in the ontology of particular Sparser configurations.



These are "org" files (http://orgmode.org). They are expected
to be read in emacs. Typing a <tab> will open or close the
listing of categories below the line you are on.


Different configurations can define markedly different sets of
categories. The biology configuration defines dramatically more
kinds of proteins and cell types than the fire configuration

The set of categories is determined by the value of the
:grammar-configuration in the script
