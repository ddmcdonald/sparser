#+TITLE: Introduction to Emacs org-mode 

This document shows by example how to write plain text documents
according to the org-mode conventions.

* Heading 1

Blocks of text under are paragraphs. Plain text. A single line break
is treated as a space when exporting to LaTeX, PDF, etc. Text can
include links to web pages (http://www.sift.net/). Don't worry about
using special formatting to anchor the URL under text links. Links can
also refer to other files in the repository, for example, the manual
lives at: file:../doc/manual/main.tex. Note that org-mode is smart
about that trailing period not being part of the filename.

This is a new paragraph. The first line of this file tells Emacs that
it's not just plain text, but also uses org-mode formatting. You need
to always either include this line, or give your file the org
suffix. The TITLE line tells org-mode what the document title is, so
that it can do the right thing when exporting to other formats. If you
omit the title, export will take the first bit of text to be the
title. There is also an AUTHOR line; use "Alpha Bravo and Junior Wells
and Fifty Cent" as in LaTeX.  More header options:

* Heading 2

Sometimes, we want lists of things (like for agendas). Format these
with hyphens:
- Top-level list items are flush left.
- This is an easy way to take notes.
- If I want sub-bullets for some reason.
  - I just indent them further.
  - The standard in org-mode is to indent a sub-bullet to line up with
    the left edge of the text of its parent.
There are also numbered lists:
1. Just like bullet lists except with a number and a period.
2. The export to LaTeX, PDF, etc. will do the right thing with
   formatting.
And finally there's a description list.
- The item :: Written just like a bullet list, but separate the item
              and its description with a double-colon.
- List types are different :: Don't mix the different types of items
     in a single list. The exporters will get confused.

* Heading 3

Sometimes we need subsections. These just get more * characters.

** Subheading (equivalent to 3.1)

Then, more text. Or more lists.

** Another Subheading (3.2)

- For emphasis, use *bold*, just like in email.
- /Italics/ also works.
- We can also have +monospace+ for code.
- For multi-line code examples use:
  #+begin_example
  Begin my code
    it's my code
  End my code
  #+end_example

Org-mode understands LaTeX, and it usually does the right thing when
exporting a $\frac{\mathit{mathematical}}{\mathrm{formula}}$ to
PDF. But it does /not/ run =latex2html= when exporting HTML.

** Exprting org-mode documents
To export an org-mode document from Emacs into some other format, type
=C-c C-e=. This will pull up a menu with a number of options for
different export formats:
- Press =l= for a LaTeX file.
- Press =p= for PDF (requires pdflatex on your system, and goes via
  LaTeX).
- Press =a= for plain (ASCII) text.
- Press =h= for an HTML file.
The generated file will have the same root name as your org-mode file,
with the appropriate suffix.
