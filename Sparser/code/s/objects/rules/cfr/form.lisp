;;;    Module:   "objects;rules:cfr:"
;;;   Version:   April 2024

;; 6.0 (9/4/92 v2.3) Reworked the definition for parsimony with other cases
;;      and to have form and referent redone for already existing rules
;; 6.1 (12/21) Added option to allow duplications and redesigned the
;;      duplication check, which looked like it wouldn't work for the polywords
;;      it was designed for.
;; 6.2 (3/9/93) changed update on known rule to use a subroutine
;;     (8/17) changed the subroutine's arguments
;; 6.3 (8/27) renamed the calls that handle possible duplication and
;;      made the threading more obvious
;; 6.4 (4/25/95) Changed the lookup call that checks for duplicate rules
;;      because it wasn't working, with the effect that the actual dup. check
;;      was being done in the Multiply, with a reversed set of args.
;; 6.5 (8/3/11) Added a schema keyword so the default can be overriden.
;; 6.6 (3/18/13) Refactored def-cfr/expr to break out define-cfr/resolved so
;;      there's a resolved entry point with the duplicate check
;; (1/18/16) Somewhere along the line, the ability to make multiple rules
;;   (with different referents) for the same word was lost. Put it back.
