;;;   Module:  "objects;chart:words:lookup:"
;;;  Version:  September 2021

;; 4.0 (9/28/92 v2.3) accomodates changes to tokenizer
;; 4.1 (7/16/93) updated field name
;; 4.2 (1/27/94) added Unknown-word?
;;     (12/12) added simplest case of make-word routine
;; 4.3 (1/9/95) added hook for introducing brackets
;; 4.4 (7/29/11) added new option that looks for primed knowledge
;;      about the word. 8/1 broke out make-word-from-lookup-buffer
;;     (3/1/12) quiet compiler
;; 4.5 (7/10/14) Added hook to affix-checker inside make-word/all-properties
;; 4.6 (10/7/14) moved the call to catalog before the operations
;;      that can set up all the other words that go with, e.g. a verb.
;;      That fixed bug where the new forms didn't see the original oblique
;;      form of the lemma and build a new one. 
;;     (10/14/14) added make-word/all-properties/or-primed
;;     (6/9/15) Added another case to it.
