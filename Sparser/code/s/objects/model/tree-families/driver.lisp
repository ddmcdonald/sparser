;; initiated 8/4/92, fleshed out 8/27, elaborated 8/31
;; fixed a bug in how lists of rules were accumulated 11/2
;; 0.1 (6/1/93 v2.3) Added possibility for a schema to use form rules
;;      in its mapping data
;;     (7/19) fixed glitch in treatment of category's plist
;; 0.2 (8/4) added relation to cfrs when they're instantiated
;; 0.3 (10/25) allowed multiple categories to be mapped to terms
;;     (1/17/94) added :adjective case as c&s of :word
;; 0.4 (3/21) added check that head-words are defined
;; 0.5 (4/29) improved the treatment of the :instantiate-individual referent instr.
;; 0.6 (5/24) added case of time-deictics. 5/26 added adverbs
;;     (10/17) propagated a change in arguments
;; 0.7 (10/20) rewrote the multiple-term rhs iterators
;; 0.8 (11/1) hacked Make-rules-for-rdata to check for the head word specifying
;;      a lambda variable rather than a word.
;; 0.9 (2/28/95) made changes to return value of inner loop of rule of schema 
;;      instantiation to make it a flat list of cfrs. Higher loop may need to
;;      check as well.
;;     (3/7) put in the higher loop
;; 0.10 (5/15) added eft-case-rule-form to be clever about the passive
;; 0.11 (7/28) tweeked the referent construction routines to accomodate single categories
;; 0.12 (12/6) fixed a policy bug in Construct-referent such that it had preferred 'head'
;;       to instantiate-individual stmts, which was wrong.
;; 1.0 (2/15/98) Redit Instantiate-rule-schema in terms of structures for the
;;      schematic cases. 2/16 added schema to each cfr made. 2/19 included
;;      residual case for 'additional-rules'. *schema-being-instantiated* added
;;      as a global 2/24. 3/7 fixed c&s bug in Construct-referent.
;; 1.1 (7/20) Reorganized the threading to match the reorg of the callers in
;;      rdata1 so that the rules are passed back up rather than being cached
;;      on the category within here. (7/23) re-org'd the multiply-through-rhs because
;;      it was overly complicated. Moved out the checking of old-rules to the
;;      caller in rdata1 because it the timing made it inflict colateral damage.
;; 1.2 (8/14/99) Tweaked Construct-referent and Massage-referent-schema to handle
;;      the case of :function referent schemas better. N.b. there's now a provision
;;      for zero or one argument to the function. This should be generalized.
;; 1.3 (9/3) Modified Apply-realization-schema-to-individual to accomodate a
;;      :no-head-word value for that field in rdata-schema.
;;     (3/31/05) touched it while debugging. (4/11) incorporated case of secondary
;;      function calls into Construct-referent - needed for general treatment of
;;      'fiscal' and the adjective-creates-subtype etf.
;; 1.4 (7/2/07) Added a define-rewriting-form-rule to go with every regular cfr
;;      that's instantiated when that makes sense. Guarded by *new-dm&p*.
;;     (8/7) replaced the guard with the more specific *infer-rewriting-form-rules*.
;; 1.5 (4/20/09) Reworked Construct-referent to look for mappings of subtype
;;     labels. Motivated by "get out of the car" and transitive/specializing-pp.
;; 1.6 (6/17/09) Lets the form derive from the schema as well as heuristically
;; 2.0 (7/24/09) Now that variables are lexicalized we have to pass the category
;;      down to the interpretation of the mapping to ensure that the correct,
;;      category-specific variables are used -- see decode-binding
;;     (10/8/09) Fixed bug in decode-binding. (4/6/11) cleaned up indents.
;; 2.1 (4/8/11) Put in switch to control formation of form rules when the
;;      rhs involves a form category. 9/9 put :method in, fixed but in 
;;      construct-referent for function case. 9/23 put method further in. 10/3 fixed
;;      bug in it (C&S).
;; 2.2 (4/3/13) Installed check for Chomsky adjunction in the inner loop.
;;     (6/13/13) Fixed case of :self as a variable in decode-binding. Flagged it
;;      as illegal. (8/12/14) added retrieve-single-rule-from-individual
;;     (9/9/14) retrieve-single-rule-from-individual got a case where there were
;;      two rules (independent bug?) so changed it's error to a cerror.
;;     1/5/2015 MAJOR CHANGE. Added new field rhs-forms to cfrs, and fill it 
;;       from the ETF schema. Used to check syntactic plausibility of rule applications
;; 2.3 (3/16/15) Broke i/r/s/-coordinate-chomsky-adjunction into the original case
;;      when the lhs is multiple (which doesn't handles multiple rhs elements!)
;;      and a simpler one-lhs case that calls the existing multiple-rhs function. 
;; 4/20/2015 create a list (*dont-check-forms-for-etf*) of etf names for which syntactic form-checking is turnes off
;;  Control check-rule-form -- it can be turned off for particular ETFs by calling
;;  dont-check-rule-form-for-etf-named with the name of the family
