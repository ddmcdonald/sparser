;;;    File: "proteins"
;;;  Module: "grammar/model/sl/biology/
;;; version: June 2015

;; initiated 9/8/14 lifting from other files
;; Made some of the proteins lower case, becasue both 
;; capitalized and lower case versions occur
;; 1/1/2015 attempt to fix problem with MEK not being defined as a word
;;  -- allow for members to be added to family after family is defined
;; attempt to get around order dependency for MEK1 and MEK -- BUT THAT WAS NOT THE BUG
;; OVER TO YOU, <<DAVID>>
;; 1/7/2015 added new "proteins" -- ubiquitin, hormone and histone, and stubs for mUbRAS and SAPK
;; new rule for protein --> (protein point-mutation) for "ubiquitin C77G"
;; 5/16/2015 add all of the protein information that is safe (does not redefine parens and brackets or defined words)
;;  about 1400 new proteins with several synonyms each
;; 5/30/2015 Give the MITRE-LINK the right UniProt: prefix,
;; add definitions for cadherin, Src, BCR-ABL and "poly(ADP–ribose)"
;; 6/28/15 un-ignored p53
;; 7/6/2015 Support for macro def-ras2-protein to mark proteins that are mentioned in the MITRE RAS 2-hop model
