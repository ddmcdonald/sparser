    "Government mandates of new safety technology are classic trade-offs, whether the product is a power tool or a car or a pill. In this case, regulations requiring that table saws be sold with this safety device might mean a few thousand fingers saved per year. But they might also lead to higher costs for consumers.
  Among tools likely to be found in someone’s garage, table saws are the biggest driver of serious woodworking-related injuries: Each year they are responsible for about 30,000 injuries that require emergency department treatment — and nearly 4,300 amputations.
  By comparison, the thousands of other products tracked by the Consumer Protection Safety Commission, a federal agency, are responsible for roughly 3,600 amputations per year combined.

"The Effects of Social Support on Sleep Quality of Medical Staff Treating Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January and February 2020 in China"

;; Abstract
[ Background ]
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), formerly known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a multivariate analysis method to determine the structural relationship between measured variables. This observational study aimed to use SEM to determine the effects of social support on sleep quality and function of medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 in January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China."

[ Material/Methods ]
"A one-month cross-sectional observational study included 180 medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection. Levels of anxiety, self-efficacy, stress, sleep quality, and social support were measured using the and the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction (SASR) questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Social Support Rate Scale (SSRS), respectively. Pearson’s correlation analysis and SEM identified the interactions between these factors."

[ Results }
"Levels of social support for medical staff were significantly associated with self-efficacy and sleep quality and negatively associated with the degree of anxiety and stress. Levels of anxiety were significantly associated with the levels of stress, which negatively impacted self-efficacy and sleep quality. Anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy were mediating variables associated with social support and sleep quality."

[ Conclusions ]
"SEM showed that medical staff in China who were treating patients with COVID-19 infection during January and February 2020 had levels of anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy that were dependent on sleep quality and social support."

A new strain of the H1N1 swine flu virus is spreading silently in workers on pig farms in China and should be “urgently” controlled to avoid another pandemic, a team of scientists says in a new study.

H1N1 is highly transmissible and spread around the world in 2009, killing about 285,000 people and morphing into seasonal flu.

The newer strain, known as G4 EA H1N1, has been common on China’s pig farms since 2016 and replicates efficiently in human airways, according to the study published on Monday. So far, it has infected some people without causing disease, but health experts fear that could change without warning.

\“G4 viruses have all the essential hallmarks of a candidate pandemic virus,” the study said, adding that controlling the spread in pigs and closely monitoring human populations “should be urgently implemented.\”

Eurasian variations of H1N1 have been circulating in pigs in Europe and Asia for decades, the study said, but the incidence of G4 viruses in farmed Chinese pigs with respiratory symptoms began rising sharply after 2014.

Recent evidence \“indicates that G4 EA H1N1 virus is a growing problem in pig farms, and the widespread circulation of G4 viruses in pigs inevitably increases their exposure to humans,\” it said.

Experts believe the drug is effective in calming the overactive immune response known as a cytokine storm. For patients on ventilators, it reduced the death rate by a third, the scientists said. For those on oxygen, death rates dropped by a fifth. The drug showed no benefit for patients who did not need respiratory support. Another benefit of the drug is that it’s very cheap — around $8 per treatment, according to one of the leaders of the trial.

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.07.982264v3.full

Abstract

SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of viral pneumonia around the world. While genetically distinct from the original SARS-CoV, both group 2B CoVs share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses harbored in bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate type-I Interferon (IFN-I) sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel CoV is much more sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment. Examining transcriptional factor activation and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) induction, SARS-CoV-2 in the context of type I IFN induces phosphorylation of STAT1 and increased ISG proteins. In contrast, the original SARS-CoV has no evidence for STAT1 phosphorylation or ISG protein increases even in the presence of type I IFN pretreatment. Next, we examined IFN competent Calu3 2B4 cells finding SARS-CoV-2 had reduced viral replication relative to SARS-CoV and induced STAT1 phosphorylation late during infection. Finally, we examined homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading frame (ORF) 3b and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in susceptibility to the IFN-I response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. that could help inform disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.

Importance 
With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 disease, differences between the SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV could be leveraged to inform disease progression and eventual treatment options. In addition, these findings could have key implications for animal model development as well as further research into how SARS-CoV-2 modulates the type I IFN response early during infection.


Introduction

At the end of 2019, a cluster of patients in Hubei Province, China was diagnosed with a viral pneumonia of unknown origins. With community links to the Hunnan seafood market in Wuhan, the disease cluster had echoes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak that emerged at the beginning of the century (1). The 2019 etiologic agent was identified as a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2 (2). The new virus has nearly 80% nucleotide identity to the original SARS-CoV and the corresponding CoV disease, COVID-19, has many of the hallmarks of SARS-CoV disease including fever, breathing difficulty, bilateral lung infiltration, and death in the most extreme cases (3, 4). In addition, the most severe SARS-CoV-2 disease corresponded to old age (>50 years old), health status, and health care workers, similar to both SARS and MERS-CoV (5). Together, the results indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease have strong similarity to the original SARS-CoV epidemic occurring nearly two decades earlier.

In the wake of the outbreak, major research efforts have sought to rapidly characterize the novel CoV to aid in treatment and control. Initial modeling studies predicted (6) and subsequent cell culture studies confirmed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 utilizes human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry, the same receptor as SARS-CoV (7, 8). Extensive case studies indicated a similar range of disease onset and severe symptoms seen with SARS-CoV (5). Notably, less severe SARS-CoV-2 cases have also been observed and were not captured in the original SARS-CoV outbreak. Importantly, screening and treatment guidance has relied on previous CoV data generated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Treatments with both protease inhibitors and type I interferon (IFN-I) have been employed (4); similarly, remdesivir, a drug targeting viral polymerases, has been reported to have efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 similar to findings with both SARS- and MERS-CoV (9–12). Importantly, several vaccine efforts have been initiated with a focus on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the major antigenic determinate (13). Together, the similarities with SARS-CoV have been useful in responding to the newest CoV outbreak.

The host Innate immune response is initiated when viral products are recognized by host cell pattern recognition receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) (14, 15). This response ultimately results in production of IFN-I and other cytokines, which together are essential for an effective antiviral response (16). IFN-I then triggers its own signaling cascade via its receptor, in autocrine or paracrine manner, which induces phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. Together, STAT1, STAT2, and a third transcription factor, IRF9, form the Interferon Stimulated Gene Factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, which is essential for induction of many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and ultimately and effective antiviral response (17, 18). To establish productive replication, viruses have developed different mechanisms to escape this antiviral response targeting different parts of the IFN-I response machinery (19).

n this study, we further characterize SARS-CoV-2 and compare it to the original SARS-CoV. Using Vero E6 cells, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication kinetics as SARS-CoV following a low dose infection. In contrast, we find that SARS-CoV-2 is much more sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment as compared to SARS-CoV. Examining further, we determined that SARS-CoV-2 induces STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG expression, which is absent in SARS-CoV. Similarly, infection of IFN competent Calu3 2B4 cells resulted in reduced SARS-Cov-2 replication and STAT1 phosphorylation at late times. These results suggest distinct changes between the CoVs in terms of IFN antagonism and we subsequently examined sequence homology between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins that may be responsible for these differences. Together, the results suggest SARS-CoV-2 lacks the same capacity to control the IFN-I response as SARS-CoV.

Results

Our initial studies infected Vero E6 cells using a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to explore the viral replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV. Following infection, we find that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar kinetics, peaking 48 hours post infection (Fig. 1A). While SARS-CoV-2 titer had slightly lower viral titers at 24 hours post infection, the results were statistically different between the novel CoV and the original epidemic strain. By 48 hours, replication of both viruses had plateaued and significant cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Together, the results indicated that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar replication kinetics in Vero E6 cells.

[[ figure 1 ]]

We next evaluated the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN-I pretreatment. Treatment with IFN-I (recombinant IFNα) has been attempted as an antiviral approach for a wide variety of pathogens including hepatitis B and C viruses as well as HIV (20). During both the SARS and MERS-CoV outbreaks, IFN-I has been employed with limited effect (21, 22). In this study, we pretreated Vero E6 cells with 1000 units of recombinant IFN-I (IFN-α) 18 hours prior to infection. Vero E6 lack the capacity to produce IFN-I, but are able to respond to exogenous treatment (23). Following pretreatment with IFN-I, SARS-CoV infection has a modest reduction in viral titer (1.5 log plaque forming units (PFU) as compared to untreated control 24 hours post infection (Fig. 1B). However, by 48 hours, SARS-CoV has nearly equivalent viral yields as the untreated conditions (7.2 log PFU versus 7.5 log PFU). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 shows a significant reduction in viral replication following IFN-I treatment. At both 24 and 48 hours post infection, SARS-CoV-2 had massive 3-log (24 HPI) and 4-log (48 HPI) drops in viral titer as compared to control untreated cells. Finally, we examined viral protein production finding a major deficit in nucleocapsid protein production in IFN-I treated cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1C). In contrast, viral proteins were robustly expressed for SARS-CoV-2 in untreated cells and for SARS-CoV in both conditions. Together, the results demonstrate a clear sensitivity to a primed IFN-I response in SARS-CoV-2, which is not observed with SARS-CoV.

SARS-CoV-2 fails to attenuate STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG production

To explore differences in IFN-I antagonism between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV, we examined both STAT1 activation and IFN stimulated gene (ISG) expression following IFN pretreatment and infection. Examining Vero cell protein lysates, we found that IFN-I treated cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 induced phosphorylated STAT-1 by 48 hours post infection (Fig. 2). STAT1 phosphorylation was absent in untreated cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and suggest the novel CoV is unable to inhibit a IFN-I preprimed response. In contrast, SARS-CoV had no evidence for STAT1 phosphorylation in either IFN-I treated or untreated cells, illustrating robust control over IFN-I induction pathways. Examining further, STAT1, IFIT2, and TRIM25, known ISGs (17), had increased protein expression in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection following IFN pretreatment (Fig. 2). Basal STAT1 and TRIM25 levels are reduced during SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to control likely due to the mRNA targeting activity of non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) (24). However, IFN-I treatment results in augmented protein levels for both ISGs following SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to untreated control. In contrast, IFN treated SARS-CoV had no significant increase in ISG protein relative to control infection. Together, the STAT1 phosphorylation, ISG production, and viral protein levels indicate that SARS-CoV-2 lacks the same capacity to modulate a primed type I IFN response as the original SARS-CoV.

[[ figure 2 ]]

SARS-CoV-2 induces STAT1 phosphorylation in interferon competent cells

While capable of responding to exogenous type I IFN, Vero cells lack the capacity to produce type I IFN following infection which likely plays a role in robust replication of a wide range of viruses []. To evaluate SARS-CoV-2 in a type I IFN responsive cell type, we infected Calu3 2B4 cells, a lung epithelial cell line sorted for ACE2 expression and previously used in coronavirus and influenza research (25). Using an MOI of 1, we examined the viral replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV in Calu3 cells. We found that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar overall kinetics, peaking 24 hours post infection (Fig. 3A). However, SARS-CoV-2 replication is slightly attenuated relative to SARS-CoV at 24 hours post infection (0.82 log reduction). The attenuation in viral replication expands at 48 hours (1.4 log reduction) indicating a significant change in total viral titers between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Notably, no similar attenuation was observed in untreated Vero cells (Fig. 1A) suggesting possible immune modulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

[[ figure 3 ]]

To further evaluate type I IFN induction, we examined both STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG expression following infection of Calu3 2B4 cells at 48 hours. Examining Calu3 cell protein lysates, we found cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 induced phosphorylated STAT-1 by 48 hours post infection (Fig. 3B). These results correspond to type I IFN treated Vero cell findings (Fig. 2) and suggest that the novel CoV is unable to completely inhibit the IFN-I response. In contrast, SARS-CoV had no evidence for STAT1 phosphorylation Calu3 cells, illustrating robust control over IFN-I induction pathways. Similar to the Vero IFN pretreatment, augmented levels of total STAT1 was observed in SARS-CoV-2 relative SARS-CoV, although with not as dramatic an increase. Similarly, TRIM25 was found to be reduced in both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 indicating that both viruses disrupt host protein production, likely due to mRNA antagonism by CoV NSP1 (24). Overall, the data from Calu3 cells confirm that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to maintain similar control over the IFN-I response as SARS-CoV.


Conservation of IFN antagonists across SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

Considering the sensitivity to IFN-I, we next sought to evaluate changes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Previous work has established several key IFN antagonist in the SARS-CoV genome including NSP1, NSP3, ORF3b, ORF6, and others (26). Therefore, we compared the sequence homology across viral proteins from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and several bat SARS-like viruses including WIV16-CoV (27), SHC014-CoV (28), and HKU3.1-CoV (29). Using sequence analysis, we found several changes to SARS-CoV-2 that potentially contribute to its type I IFN sensitivity (Fig. 4). For SARS-CoV structural proteins including the nucleocapsid (N) and matrix (M) protein, a high degree of sequence homology (>90%AA identity) suggests that their reported IFN antagonism is likely maintained in SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like viruses. Similarly, the ORF1ab poly-protein retains high sequence identity in SARS-CoV-2 and several known antagonists contained within the poly-protein (NSP1, NSP7, NSP14-16) are highly conserved relative to SARS-CoV. One notable exception is the large papain-like proteases, NSP3, which only 76% conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. However, SARS-CoV-2 does maintain a deubiquitinating domain thought to confer IFN resistance (30). For SARS-CoV ORF3b, a 154 amino acid (AA) protein known to antagonize the type I IFN responses by blocking IRF3 phosphorylation (31), sequence alignments indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 equivalent ORF3b contains a premature stop codon resulting in a truncated 24 AA protein. Similarly, HKU3.1-CoV also has a premature termination resulting in a predicted 39 AA protein. Both WIV16-CoV and SHC014-CoV, the most closely related bat viruses to SARS-CoV, encode longer 114 AA truncated protein with >99% homology with SARS-CoV ORF3b suggesting that IFN antagonism might be maintained in these specific group 2B CoV strains. In addition, SARS-CoV ORF6 has been shown to be an IFN antagonist that disrupts karyopherin transportation of transcriptions factors like STAT1 (31, 32). In contrast to ORF3b, all five surveyed group 2B CoVs maintain ORF6; however, SARS-CoV-2 had only 69% homology with SARS-CoV while the other three group 2B bat CoVs had >90% conservation. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 has a two amino acid truncation in its ORF6; previous work has found that alanine substitution in this C-terminal of SARS-CoV ORF6 resulted in ablated antagonism (32). Together, the sequence homology analysis suggests that differences in NSP3, ORF3b, and/or ORF6 may be key drivers of SARS-CoV-2 type I IFN susceptibility.

Discussion

With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, viral characterization remains a key factor in responding to the emergent novel virus. In this report, we describe differences in the IFN-I sensitivity between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV. While both viruses maintain similar replication in untreated Vero E6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 has a significant decrease in viral protein and replication following IFN-I pretreatment. The decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication correlates with phosphorylation of STAT1 and augmented ISG expression largely absent following SARS-CoV infection despite IFN-I pretreatment. Notably, infection of IFN competent Calu3 2B4 cells also resulted in reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication relative to SARS-CoV. This modest reduction in viral replication corresponded to STAT1 phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu3 cells and indicated an inability to block type I IFN activation. the sensitivity to IFN-I is distinct from the original SARS-CoV and suggests that the novel CoV has distinct host interactions driving disease outcomes. Analysis of viral proteins finds SARS-CoV-2 has several changes that potentially impact its capacity to modulate the type I IFN response, including loss of ORF3b and a short truncation of ORF6, both known as IFN-I antagonists for SARS-CoV (31). Together, our results suggest SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have differences in their ability to antagonize the IFN-I response once initiated and that they may have major implication for COVID-19 disease and treatment.

With a similar genome organization and disease symptoms in humans, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has drawn insights from the closely related SARS-CoV. However, the differences in sensitivity to IFN-I pretreatment illustrate a clear distinction between the two CoVs. Coupled with a novel furin cleavage site (33), robust upper airway infection (8), and potential transmission prior to symptomatic disease (34), the differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 could prove important in disrupting the ongoing spread of COVID-19. For SARS-CoV, in vitro studies have consistently found that wild-type SARS-CoV is indifferent to IFN-I pretreatment (35, 36). Similarly, in vivo SARS-CoV studies have found that the loss of IFN-I signaling had no significant impact on disease (37), suggesting that this virus is not sensitive to the antiviral effects of IFN-I. However, more recent reports suggest that host genetic background may majorly influence this finding (38). For SARS-CoV-2, our results suggest that IFN-I pretreatment produces a 3 - 4 log drop in viral titer and correlates to STAT1 phosphorylation. This level of sensitivity is similar to MERS-CoV and suggests that the novel CoV lacks the same capacity to escape a primed IFN-I response as SARS-CoV (39, 40). Notably, the sensitivity to IFN-I does not completely ablate viral replication; unlike SARS-CoV 2’O methyl-transferase mutants (35), SARS-CoV-2 is able to replicate to low, detectable levels even in the presence of IFN-I. This finding could help explain positive test in patients with minimal symptoms and the range of disease observed. In addition, while SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to IFN-I pretreatment, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV employ effective means to disrupt virus recognition and downstream signaling until late during infection (25). While SARS-CoV-2 may employ a similar mechanism early during infection, STAT1 phosphorylation and reduced viral replication are observed in IFN competent Calu3 indicating that the novel CoV does not as effectively block IFN-I signaling as the original SARS-CoV

For SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity to IFN-I indicates a distinction from SARS-CoV and suggests differential host innate immune modulation between the viruses. The loss of ORF3b and truncation/changes in ORF6 could signal a reduced capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to interfere with type I IFN responses. For SARS-CoV ORF6, the N-terminal domain has been shown to have a clear role in its ability to disrupt karyopherin transport (32); in turn, the loss of ORF6 function for SARS-CoV-2 would likely render it much more susceptible to IFN-I pretreatment as activated STAT1 has the capacity to enter the nucleus and induce ISGs and the antiviral response. In these studies, we have found that following IFN-I pretreatment, STAT1 phosphorylation is induced following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The increase in ISG proteins (STAT1, IFIT2, TRIM25) suggests that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 does not effectively block nuclear transport as well as SARS ORF6. For SARS-CoV ORF3b, the viral protein has been shown to disrupt phosphorylation of IRF3, a key transcriptional factor in the induction of IFN-I and the antiviral state (31). While its mechanism of action is not clear, the ORF3b absence in SARS-CoV-2 infection likely impacts its ability to inhibit the IFN-I response and eventual STAT1 activation. Similarly, while NSP3 deubiquitinating domain remains intact, SARS-CoV-2 has a 24 AA insertion upstream of this deubiquitinating domain that could potentially alter that function (30). While other antagonists are maintained with high levels of conservation (>90%), single point mutations in key locations could modify function and contribute to increased IFN sensitivity. Overall, the sequence analysis suggests that differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins may drive attenuation in the context of type I IFN pretreatment.

The increased sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 suggests utility in treatment using type I IFN. While IFN-I has been used in response to chronic viral infection (41), previous examination of SARS-CoV cases found inconclusive effect for type I IFN treatment (42). However, the findings from the SARS-CoV outbreak were complicated by combination therapy of type I IFN with other treatments including ribavirin/steroids and lack of a regimented protocol. While type I IFN has been utilized to treat MERS-CoV infected patients, no conclusive data yet exists to determine efficacy (43). Yet, in vivo studies with MERS-CoV has found that early induction with type I IFN can be protective in mice (44); importantly, the same study found that late type I IFN induction can be detrimental for MERS-CoV disease (44). Similarly, early reports have described treatments using type I IFN in combination for SARS-CoV-2 infection; yet the efficacy of these treatments and the parameters of their use are not known (45). Overall, sensitivity data suggest that type I IFN treatment may have utility for treating SARS-CoV-2 if the appropriate parameters can be determined. In addition, use of type III IFN, which is predicted to have utility in the respiratory tract, could offer another means for effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2.

In addition to treatment, the sensitivity to type I IFN may also have implications for animal model development. For SARS-CoV, mouse models that recapitulate human disease were developed through virus passage in immune competent mice (46). Similarly, mouse models for MERS-CoV required adaptation in mice that had genetic modifications of their dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV (47, 48). However, each of these MERS-CoV mouse models still retained full immune capacity. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to type I IFN may signal the need to use an immune deficient model to develop relevant disease. While initial work has suggested incompatibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice based on receptor usage (8), the type I IFN response may be a second major barrier that needs to be overcome. Similar to the emergent Zika virus outbreak, the use of type I IFN receptor knockout mice or type I IFN receptor blocking antibody may be necessary to develop a useful SARS-CoV-2 animal models for therapeutic testing (49).

Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher sensitivity to type I IFN than the previously emergent SARS-CoV. This augmented type I IFN sensitivity is likely due to changes in viral proteins between the two epidemic CoV strains. Moving forward, these data could provide important insights for both the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 as well as developing novel animal models of disease. In this ongoing outbreak, the results also highlight a distinction between the highly related viruses and suggest insights from SARS-CoV must be verified for SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease.

Given the scale and rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) acute respiratory disease, there is an immediate need for medicines that can help before a vaccine can be produced. Results of rapid sequencing of 2019-nCoV, coupled with molecular modelling based on the genomes of related virus proteins, have suggested a few compounds that are likely to be effective, including the anti-HIV lopinavir plus ritonavir combination.

BenevolentAI’s knowledge graph is a large repository of structured medical information, including numerous connections extracted from scientific literature by machine learning. Together with customisations bespoke to 2019-nCoV, we used BenevolentAI to search for approved drugs that could help, focusing on those that might block the viral infection process. We identified baricitinib, which is predicted to reduce the ability of the virus to infect lung cells.

Most viruses enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The receptor that 2019-nCoV uses to infect lung cells might be ACE2, a cell-surface protein on cells in the kidney, blood vessels, heart, and, importantly, lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells (figure). These AT2 cells are particularly prone to viral infection. One of the known regulators of endocytosis is the AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). Disruption of AAK1 might, in turn, interrupt the passage of the virus into cells and also the intracellular assembly of virus particles.

Of 378 AAK1 inhibitors in the knowledge graph, 47 have been approved for medical use and six inhibited AAK1 with high affinity. These included a number of oncology drugs such as sunitinib and erlotinib, both of which have been shown to inhibit viral infection of cells through the inhibition of AAK1. However, these compounds bring serious side-effects, and our data infer high doses to inhibit AAK1 effectively. We do not consider these drugs would be a safe therapy for a population of sick and infected people.

By contrast, one of the six high-affinity AAK1-binding drugs was the janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib, which also binds the cyclin G-associated kinase, another regulator of endocytosis. Because the plasma concentration of baricitinib on therapeutic dosing (either as 2 mg or 4 mg once daily) is sufficient to inhibit AAK1, we suggest it could be trialled, using an appropriate patient population with 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, to reduce both the viral entry and the inflammation in patients, using endpoints such as the MuLBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting mortality in viral pneumonia.

Figure: Viral entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis
The virus binds through its spike protein to ACE2 on the surface of AT2 epithelial cells (1), which induces activation of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. AAK1- and GAK-mediated phosphorylation of clathrin adapter proteins (2) starts the assembly of the clathrin cage around the enclosed virus, before it is pinched off and trafficked to endosomes (3). Inhibition of AAK1 and GAK by baricitinib thereby inhibits virus entry. SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

(defun brent-CaM-Ras ()
  (p "Fine tuning of Ras activity is widely known as a mechanism to induce
different cellular responses. Recently, we have shown that calmodulin (CaM)
binds to K-Ras and that K-Ras phosphorylation inhibits its
interaction with CaM. In this study we report that CaM inhibits K-Ras
phosphorylation at Ser181 by protein kinase C (PKC) in vivo, and this is
a mechanism to modulate K-Ras activity and signaling. Although CaM
inhibition increased the activation of endogenous K-Ras, PKC inhibition
decreased its activation status. We demonstrate that K-Ras
phosphorylation decreased susceptibility to p120GAP activity.
Accordingly, we also observed that non-phosphorylable K-Ras mutant
exhibits a less sustained activation profile and do not efficiently
activate AKT at low growth factor doses compared with wild-type K-Ras.
It is interesting that the physiological responses induced by K-Ras are
affected by this phosphorylation; when K-Ras cannot be phosphorylated it
exhibits a remarkably decreased ability to stimulate proliferation in
non-saturated serum conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that
phosphorylation also regulates oncogenic K-Ras functions, as focus
formation capacity, mobility and apoptosis resistance upon adriamycin
treatment of cells expressing oncogenic K-Ras that cannot be
phosphorylated are highly compromised. Moreover, at low serum
concentration proliferation and survival is practically inhibited when
cells cannot phosphorylate oncogenic K-Ras. In this condition, K-Ras
phosphorylation is essential to ensure a proper activation of
mitogen-activated protein kinase and PI3K/AKT pathways. In summary, our
findings suggest that the interplay between CaM interaction and PKC
phosphorylation is essential to regulate non-oncogenic and oncogenic
K-Ras activity and functionality."))

#| From Reactome. Descrption of "SPRED dimer binds NF1"
Sprouty-related proteins (SPRED) 1, 2 and 3 are negative regulators
of the MAPK pathway that act at least in part by recruiting
the RAS GAP protein neurofibromin 1 (NF1) to the plasma membrane
(Kato et al, 2003; King et al, 2006; Stowe et al, 2012).
NF1, a negative regulator of RAS is a tumor suppressor that is mutated
in the familial cancer syndrome neurofibromatosis I as well as
in sporadic cases of glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancers,
neuroblastoma and melanoma (Martin et al, 1990; Bollag et al, 1996;
reviewed in Bollag and McCormick, 1992; Maertens and Cichowski, 2014).

Plasma membrane-association of the SPRED proteins themselves depends on
the C-terminal SPR domain. Mutations in this region abrogate membrane localization
of the protein (King et al, 2005; Stowe et al, 2012).
Membrane association may also be promoted by interaction of the SPRED proteins
with RAS (Wakioka et al, 2001).
Interaction with NF1 is mediated by the SPRED EVH1 domain, and mutations
in this region affect both NF1 recruitment and the ability of SPRED and NF1 proteins
to negatively regulate RAS pathway activity (Stowe et al, 2012;
reviewed in McClatchey and Cichowski, 2012).

in part by phosphorylating the Elk1 transcription factor.
Phospho-Elk then upregulates the gene expression of target genes
such as the proto-oncogene c-fos.
The entire signaling cascade is terminated by
the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras
which hydrolyzes the bound GTP into GDP,
thus returning Ras to the GDP bound state
where it releases bound Raf.
The GTPase activity of Ras is accelerated
by interaction with another protein called GAP.
The oncogenic Rasv12 mutant has diminished GTPase activity
and therefore stays in the active GTP bound state constitutively.
Deletion of GAP or the related NF1 genes will also enhance Ras activity
by slowing the rate of Ras-GTP hydrolysis.")

  "The processing of the nfκb2 gene product p100 to generate p52 is a regulated event, which is important for the instrumental function of NF-κB. We previously demonstrated that this tightly controlled event is regulated positively by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and its downstream kinase, IκB kinase α (IKKα).
However, the precise mechanisms by which NIK and IKKα induce p100 processing remain unclear.
Here, we show that, besides activating IKKα, NIK also serves as a docking molecule recruiting IKKα to p100.
This novel function of NIK requires two specific amino acid residues, serine 866 and serine 870, of p100 that are known to be essential for inducible processing of p100.
We also show that, after being recruited into p100 complex, activated IKKα phosphorylates specific serines located in both N- and C-terminal regions of p100 (serines 99, 108, 115, 123, and 872).
The phosphorylation of these specific serines is the prerequisite for ubiquitination and subsequent processing of p100 mediated by the β-TrCP ubiquitin ligase and 26 S proteasome, respectively.
These results highlight the critical but different roles of NIK and IKKα in regulating p100 processing and shed light on the mechanisms mediating the tight control of p100 processing.
These data also provide the first evidence for explaining why overexpression of IKKα or its activation by many other stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor and mitogens fails to induce p100 processing.

  "Processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly controlled, which is important for proper function of NF-kappaB. Accordingly, constitutive processing of p100, caused by the loss of its C-terminal processing inhibitory domain due to nfkappab2 gene rearrangements, is associated with the development of various lymphomas and leukemia. In contrast to the physiological processing of p100 triggered by NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) and its downstream kinase, IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha), which requires the E3 ligase, beta-transducin repeat-containing protein (beta-TrCP), and occurs only in the cytoplasm, the constitutive processing of p100 is independent of beta-TrCP but rather is regulated by the nuclear shuttling of p100. Here, we show that constitutive processing of p100 also requires IKKalpha, but not IKKbeta (IkappaB kinase beta) or IKKgamma (IkappaB kinase gamma). It seems that NIK is also dispensable for this pathogenic processing of p100. These results demonstrate a general role of IKKalpha in p100 processing under both physiological and pathogenic conditions. Additionally, we find that IKKalpha is not required for the nuclear translocation of p100. Thus, these results also indicate that p100 nuclear translocation is not sufficient for the constitutive processing of p100.
