;;; Discourse phrases

;;; ===PHRASES===

;;; "novel" 
;;;  consistently shows up in abstracts. 
;;; 'The data demonstrate that Pax2 is a new target for the JNK signaling module and point 
;;; to a *novel* mechanism for mediating Pax-dependent transcription regulation.

;;; from Hallmarks of Cancer

;;; "recent results"
;;; 'Recent results have highlighted the importance of negative-feedback loops that 
;;; normally operate to dampen various types of signaling and thereby ensure homeostatic 
;;; regulation of the flux of signals coursing through the intracellular circuitry.'


;;; "early studies"
;;; 'Early studies of oncogene action encouraged the notion that ever-increasing 
;;; expression of such genes and the signals manifested in their protein products 
;;; would result in correspondingly increased cancer cell proliferation and thus tumor growth.'

;;; "recent research"
;;; 'Recent research has interrelated the acquisition of CSC traits with the EMT transdifferentiation 
;;; program discussed above (Sing and Settleman, 2010; ....)'

;;; ----------------------------------

;;; from Dragging Ras Back in the Ring

;;; "first" "classic" 
;;; 'Ras genes were the *first* oncogenes identified in human cancer cells. In a series 
;;; of *classic* experiments, the groups of Weinberg, Cooper, Barbacid, and Wigler independently 
;;; identified the transforming genes from T24/EJ bladder carcinoma cells as H-Ras (Der et al., 1982, ...). 
;;; More than 30 years later, Ras genes are well established as the most frequently mutated oncogenes in 
;;; human cancer (Table 1), though H-Ras itself is rarely one of them.' 

;;; "early efforts"
;;; 'Early efforts to block Ras cancers by preventing Ras farnesylation, once thought to be an
;;; essential posttranslational modification for Ras activity, were thwarted by the unexpected
;;; presence of a backup system (geranylgeranyltransferase) that restored activity of K-Ras and
;;; N-Ras after farnesyltransferase treatment.' 


;;; "new efforts"
;;; 'A convergence of urgent unmet clinical needs and advances in drug discovery has energized 
;;; *new efforts* to target Ras cancers within academic centers and in the biopharmaceutical industry.'

;;; "not yet" -- Adverby, but makes reference to earlier (failed) trials
;;; 'MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors have *not yet* 
;;; shown significant clinical activity in Ras cancers, for reasons relating to feedback loops and poor 
;;; therapeutic windows, among other issues discussed below.'
;;; 'Inhibitors of PI3K pathway have *not yet* fared much better in the clinic, also because of feedback
;;; mechanisms that activate upstream signaling, as well as poor therapeutic index.'

;;; "recent advances" 
;;; "ahead" (preposition/adverb)
;;; 'Here, we will discuss some of these knowledge gaps, as well as *recent advances* and the 
;;; challenges that lie *ahead*.'

;;; "recently"
;;; 'Recently, Legius and colleagues (Brems et al., 2007) discovered mutations in the Sprouty-related protein, 
;;; SPRED1, in a form of neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) in which the neurofibromin gene is wild-type.'
