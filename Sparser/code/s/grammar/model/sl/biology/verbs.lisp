;; verbs initiated 7/23/14 by lifting verbs from NFkappaB experiment. Continued
;; through 12/3/14.
;;
;; verbs2 initiated 12/3/14 by lifting verbs from verbs.lisp to provide
;; an not-loaded scratch pad for the new design
;;
;; verbs1 initiated 12/11/14 as the file to load with everything converted
;; to the new design.
;; RJB 12/20/2014 corrected bad entry for resist -- had verb as "require"
;; RJB added note for :at modifier for inhibit
;;  add :on and :at modifiers for phosphorylate
;; improved definition for increase as a noun and verb
;; remove unlikely definition of "study" as a verb 
;;    -- we need to handle ambiguity better
;; 1/2/2015 minor fixes -- mostly to get verbs with subject WE parsing 
;;   This needs to be fixed, since the category used is 
;;   the pronoun category, rather than a mixin for human
;; 1/14/2015 minor vocabulary hacking to address problems pointed out by David
;; 1/19.2015 remove all instances of "of-nominal" ETFs and replace by use of ":of object",
;; use def-synonym where needed to get noun and verb readings
;; 2/23/15 Aphabetized
;; 3/4/2015 replace definition of pseudo-verb is-bio-entity with use of 
;;   subcategorization frame -- much faster
;;   delete core definition oof "report" as verb. Use new method delete-verb-cfr
;;   correct object restriction on "express"
;;   add definition of upregulate and up-regulate
;; 3/12/15 Added pre-mod to phosphorylate for figure-7 case
;; 4/15/15 Moved in verbs from taxonomy. Quashed/merged duplicates
;; 4/23/15 Lifted out dimerize to phenomena to have it all together
;; 4/24/2015 generalized a number of V/R to biological based on evidence
;; 4/24/2015 added whethercomp as a type of verb complement
;; 4/24/2015 add definitions of translate (as in research translates to results) and delay
;; (ERK 11 "Our data demonstrate for the first time that a delay in cytoplasmic activation of ERK is directly translated into a delay in nuclear translocation.")
;; 4/27/2015 remove "load" as a verb -- all instances we see are "loading", and we
;;  want that treated like a noun
;; also add duration modifier on grow, and changes some subcat restrictions
;; 5/15/2015 substantial revision in taxonomy to drastically reduce the overloading of bio-process,
;;  provide bio-rhetorical as a marker for verbs that talk about belief and truth, bio-event for actions that are not bio-processes in the OBO sense, bio-relation for things like
;;  contain, sonstitute, etc.
;;  concomitant revision for things like thatcomp and whethercomp
;; 5/29/15 Removed things that belonged else where, notably 
;;  moved phosphoriated to phenomena to live with the other modifications
;; 5/30/2015 change poor definition of "state" to "bio-state" -- conflicted with definition of "have"
;; 6/5/2015 some vocabulary tweaks. Adjusted svo/bio/expr to take input
;; from setup-verb 7/22/15.
